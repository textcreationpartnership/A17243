            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But ſince eſpieng, that the whole work is like to grow ſo large, and of ſuch importance withal, that it is not like to be finiſhed, any thing neer within the time that before I conceived (nor convenient it ſhould, but as it may be orderly done) I have now thought good to publiſh this before, not only to the common uſe of others, but for mine own furtherance alſo. For mine opinion is, that wheras the matter is ſuch as craveth good industrie, truly to gather; and iudgement likewiſe, orderly and aptly to diſpoſe: howſoever I have yet but drawn as it were the first lines therof, yet, when I com to place it in the work it ſelfe, then by the help and iudgement of others
<pb facs="tcp:7445:3"/>(by communicating it before unto them, which otherwiſe I could not have ſo wel) I may be able the better to do it. Which help or advantage I have thought good rather to uſe in this part only of al the Bible, for that it is of al the old Testament, the principal part; and not fully inough (me think) as yet digested by others. Which that now I praeſent unto you, the only reaſon is not, for that ſomtime I have been of your companie (which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I ſo esteem of, as that I acknowledge it my bounden dutie, ever with reverence to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it) but much rather bicauſe it doth very wel accord, that ſuch as are occupied in the lawes of the Realm, &amp; now in the way to be in place of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heerafter, have ſom recourſe withal unto the righteous lawes of God, &amp; to the government that he of old to his people ordained. Wherin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have not attanied to that, which were needful to ſuch a purpoſe, nor may ſo much as hope to com any thing neer it, in the best that I am able to do: yet may it ſuffice to commend unto you this conſideration, that it ſhal be good for you to ioin the one with the other. Wherunto wheras you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie an open way in the text it ſelf, &amp; in thoſe that have written theron: if this little travel of mine, by the ſhortnes or plainnes of it may any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is the thing that I have deſired, howſoever I have praevailed therin. In which reſpect you are much beholding to the goodnes of God, that hath opened your eies ſo far, as that now you ſee it to be your duties, and a ſpecial point of wiſdom withal, to
<pb facs="tcp:7445:3"/>have ordinarie teachers of your own: and that he hath, both framed your harts to do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and given you ſo rich a bleſſing therin. By means wherof, the leſſe that ſuch weak labors of mine may be to any uſe unto you, though I am, and ſo ought to be the gladder of it; and ſo much the leſſe do need, to buſie my ſelfe to make ſupplie: yet, neither might I of dutie ſhrink from that, which I am (howſoever) enabled to do; neither is it amiſſe for you, to be admoniſhed of others beſides. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be done is little inough: but God I trust wil give ſupplie; and make you able, not only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his wil, but in ſom good meaſure alſo to do it. Vnto whoſe grace I humbly commend your ſelves, and your ſtudies, to be in ſuch ſort directed by him, as may be most to his glorie, and to the benefit of thoſe his people where your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhal be.</p>

I have therfore to give thee to underſtand, that it was of purpoſe by me omitted, partly bicauſe that many others have written of it, &amp; the book would ſo have grown to be very great: but cheefly for that it agreeth not with the courſe that I have taken, meaning firſt to ſet down the ſtorie of the church by it ſelfe: and then, under the doctrine of it, to ſhew the ſenſe of thoſe conſtitutions that were given unto it. As for the Table of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that foloweth at the end of the book, I have to this end gathered the ſame, that ſo it may more eaſily be ſeen, what texts of the law are alreadie gathered hither, and unto what place they are ſorted: that ſo it might more eaſily appeer, what they are that are omitted; and how aptly thoſe are applied that alreadie are taken.

Again, to caſt our eies on the whole, from the firſt time that they were a people, unto the latter end of them, would with the manifold varietie that it carieth with it, confound our memorie and judgement in ſuch ſort, that we ſhould be hardly able to eſpie, what we had to think therof. On the other ſide, what maner
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7445:7"/>of government was appointed of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is ſo plainly expreſſed in the law, that taking ſom pains to digeſt the ſame to ſom plainer method, we may quikly ſee what it was, and much more certainly in that rule given them from God, than in their own practiſe, which was oft times verie much corrupted by them. For the quaeſtion that I ſpeak of, and that moſt of al appertaineth to this matter, is not, under what kind of regiment they lived, or at any time was in ure and force among them: but, what kind of government it was, which it pleaſed God to appoint unto them, and under which they ought to have lived for the time that it was to them commended.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Having ſo found out the compaſſe of our matter,
<note place="margin">That which was praeſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed conſisted of two parts: the instinct of nature; and the law written.</note> and ſet out the bounds therof, we have now to ſearch, what kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it was, that it pleaſed God, then in the wildernes to appoint unto them: which was nothing els, but only that rule of aequitie which God hath printed in the hart of mankind generally, though in ſom more, in ſom leſſe; by his written word, amended and bettered, as his wiſdom thought moſt meet. For though we have not (ſince the fal) any perfection in any thing at al; yet have we a reaſonable light in ſuch matters, as do appertain to this civil or outward life of ours: and though we have a kind of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7445:7"/>knowledge in them, notwithſtanding the decay that came in by the fal; yet is the ſame ſo unperfect, that it was needful ſom way to be holpen. Hence is it, that when God would give unto them the rule and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their life (that, as he had choſen them to be a peculiar people to him, ſo they might walk ſomwhat woorthie of ſo holie a calling) he would neither altogither leave them to that inſtinct of nature as he did the reſt; bicauſe that in many things it came ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhort: neither would he give them al par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in writing; bicauſe that it was not ſo verie needful, and otherwiſe might be ſomwhat chargeable unto them, overlaieng their weaknes therwith. The form therfore of government which by God among them was eſtabliſhed, doth conſiſt of theſe two parts: the inſtinct of nature, for the one; and the ſupply which was given by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten law, for the other. In the former of which two, they were but aequal to others, for that others had that, as much as they: but in the latter they were praeferred to al, for that no people in al the world, had in thoſe dais the like judgements among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But to the end we may better perceive, what this government of theirs was, that ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of theſe two parts, we have need to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the conſideration of ech of theſe apart by it ſelfe: and ſo conſequently, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7445:8"/>with this ſame inſtinct of nature, that teacheth al ſom ſenſe of aequitie, leſſe or more.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Therfore as touching this former part of the Iſraelitiſh or Iewiſh policie,
<note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, that he hath given us.</note> which they have not proper to themſelves, but common to al, although we need not any large or abſolute diſcourſe therof: yet ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>things there are therunto belonging, that we had need to ſet before our eies, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to enter therinto. For firſt on behalfe of this work of God towards us, it ſhal be good to conſider, both what it is that he hath given us; and to what end: then alſo on our parts, how far we are able by it to have any ſound direction. That there is ſuch an inſtinct of nature, it is a thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, that it were but loſt labor to tarrie long about the proofe therof.
<note place="margin">In men.</note> For firſt of al among men, if we go to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, we have many notable examples of aequitie and upright dealing among the heathen: and divers of them ſuch, as even at this day (without al quaeſtion) they may be as excellent lights in the church of God, among us that are chriſtians. Beſides theſe examples, divers of themſelves and others have given ſo notable rules of aequitie in their writings, that although their deeds were never ſo contrarie therunto: yet might we be bold to conclude upon their writings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7445:8"/>only, that they had a certain light of upright dealing that ſhone in their harts, though themſelves walked not agreeable therunto. Again, beſides thoſe tokens of aequitie in particular duties one with another, we ſee that divers of them that were utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the word of God, had notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding excellent gifts in the way of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and notably governed much people and mightie kingdoms. And not only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particular perſons have given ſuch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the excellencies in them: but al the reſt alſo, more or leſſe; and the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in obeieng, and inclining themſelves to be in order, as wel as thoſe others in commending the ſame unto them. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is wel inough known, that unleſſe there were in the whole multitude an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therunto: it were too much for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others (were their wiſdom and policie never ſo great) to keep them in order.
<note place="margin">In other creatures.</note> But what ſpeak I of men? May we not ſee that God would have this ſo common a thing throughout the whole world among al his creatures, that he hath put ſom ſparks therof, even in beaſts and birds, and ſuch other like brutiſh creatures? For though it do leſſe appeer in them, than (for the moſt part) in men: yet even in thoſe alſo may we evidently ſee, both that they have ſom miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking of violence, diſorder, and wrong:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7445:9"/>and that ſom kinds eſpecially have a ſet policie or form of government in ordering themſelves, and com therin (though they want verie much, yet) altogither as neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, as Pope-holie perſons are like in devotion to the children of God. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therfore that we ſee ſuch infallible tokens of this inſtinct of nature, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in certain choiſe men of the world, but alſo in the verie multitude, in al ages; yea and almoſt in al living creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: there is no dowt, but that we may be bold to conclude, that in man there are certain ſparks of this kind of light. Such as the fruit is, ſuch alſo needs muſt the tree be accounted.</p>
               <p n="4">4 What God ſhould mean to leave this knowledge or ſenſe of aequitie (ſo far as it is) imprinted in al,
<note place="margin">He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to his glorie: and our benefit.</note> it is no hard matter to find. Firſt of al, if we go to a general ground, that the end of al the works of God is to ſhew foorth himſelfe, or to ſet foorth his own glorie: then may we of this alſo conclude, that he would therby make known, that aequitie in him is marvelous rife, and very abſolute, when as he hath left ſuch tokens therof in al his creatures, that he made of ſuch a nature, as by any means might be capable therof: and though more in ſom, than in others; yet ſo much in every one, as for the capacitie therof was meet. For that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7445:9"/>muſt needs be very ſweete it ſelfe, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a redolent favor to whatſoever it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by; and that work-man muſt needs be very cunning, that ſo workman-like han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth whatſoever he taketh in hand. But we wil go to another reaſon, that is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the nature of this quaeſtion. This we know, that his purpoſe was, that ſuch things as he made; ſhould both continu for the time that they were appointed: and that, in ſom reaſonable order. Of which two, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoever we do reſpect, what could be more aptly deviſed, than that there ſhuld be ſuch a ſenſe of aequitie in living creatures? For, if there be no authoritie to reſtrain ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie (as ſomtimes there is not) no laws, no puniſhment to reſtrain malefactors, what other bridle then can there be in any, but only this inward reſtraint of nature? When the outward is wanting, if there were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward help, ſoone would al be tumbled on heaps. And though there be an order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſome put in truſt to ſee the ſame obſerved: yet are they alſo found ſometimes ſo negligent, and ſomtimes ſo unable to do as they ought, one way or other, that in that caſe alſo, were not men inwardly ſtaied by that aforeſaid ſenſe of aequitie, it would ſoone be ſeen how weak the outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint were without the inward. Bleſſed be God, that hath put in our mouths this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7445:10"/>bridle without the which neither ſhould we be in order, nor be at al. Thus therfore we have to conclude, that as God hath given the deſire and appetite of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for the continual propagation of ſuch kinds, as he hath ordeined from time to time to furniſh the world; ſo hath he in like ſort given into the harts of al, this ſenſe of right and wrong (not only to be evident tokens of the great righteouſnes that is in him; but alſo) to the end that al things may better continu their time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and continu in better order.</p>
               <p n="5">5 On our parts now it is to be ſeen how far foorth this knowledge or ſenſe of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealing is able to lead us towards the performance of the ſame:
<note place="margin">This inſtinct of nature is not able to work in us any great matters in this kind.</note> a point that much appertaineth to the cauſe that we have in hand. For, if it ſelfe be ſufficient to guide us in the way of aequitie, then whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhal come in beſides, is, for that matter, more than needeth; if it be not, then the ſupply, that is given in the written word, is much more welcom. Therfore to find out, what help heerunto we have in this natural ſenſe of aequitie, we have to conſider, that there are two principal powers therof; and to ſearch out, what is the force of either of thoſe.
<note place="margin">Our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkened.</note> The one is the underſtanding of the mind: the other, the inclination of the wil. For common experience teacheth us al, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7445:10"/>both ſomtimes we know what is right; but yet are not diſpoſed to do it: and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are diſpoſed to do as we ſhould; but yet do not ſufficiently perceive what that ſhould be. Therfore as touching the former of theſe, we have to know, that a kind of light it giveth unto us; but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no ſound direction. For, firſt as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that part of righteouſnes which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth our dutie towards our firſt founder, neither doth it teach us who it is, nor what kind of ſervice we ſhould do unto him: but leaveth us to our own blind raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in both. As we may very plainly ſee, both for that, not only the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but even the wiſeſt, and the moſt ſober of al the heathen men that ever were, did ever varie (&amp; that very much) in both thoſe points, as wel among themſelves one from another, as from the people of al other countries, or ſects: and alſo, for that neither the ancient church of God under the law, nor yet Chriſtendom under the Goſpel (notwithſtanding the expreſſe word given unto them, and this moſt cleer and abſolute manifeſtation of the wil of God in that point made unto us) could ever ſoundly be brought from our native corruption on that behalfe. For where we are ſo far to ſeek notwithſtanding thoſe helps, there are we of our ſelves marvelous weak. In that part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7445:11"/>of aequitie which reſpecteth our dutie to others, we have ſom reaſonable light remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in compariſon of the other, as it may ſufficiently appeer by the monuments of many, that in writing they have left unto us: &amp; by the experience and practiſe which was in ure in al ages, and is at this praeſent among our ſelves. Howbeit, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that in the aeſtimation of wrong or diſorder, they have been in many things very much deceived: and in the aeſtimation of right and order, have been further ſhort by many degrees. An example may make the matter more plain. To take away any part of another mans goods, or a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to bear with ſuch offenders, is in moſt caſes quikly eſpied to be very il: but, that a man ſhould have ſuch a ſpecial care, to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to every one that which is his, that though by bargain, or wagers he might have it with his neighbors good wil, yet he wil not; or that a prince ſhould by laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a care to be had: that is very far, not only from the dim ſight of the heathen people, but alſo from our much better ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened eies.
<note place="margin">The inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our wil but weak.</note> Our underſtanding therfore is weak: but what ſhal we ſay of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our wil? Even the ſelfeſame. For though we have an indifferent readie wil to divers points of this aequitie: yet firſt of al, unto many others (and thoſe, for the moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7445:11"/>part, of the greateſt importance, as namely, in matters of ſound devotion) we have no readines at al; but are bent directly againſt them. Then alſo, though unto ſom of them, as I ſaid, we have ſom inclination: yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not it be ſoundly approoved of God, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that oftentimes we corrupt our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination by directing the ſame to ſom wrong end (as to avoid either the danger of laws; or els the diſpleaſure, or reproch of men) til that our wil by the written word be better framed; and partly for that though it have no ſuch meaning, with al, yet is it not grounded upon knowledge, til it hath the word written, and therfore is not the ſervice of GOD, but of our ſelves. So, though we have this inſtinct of nature, and though it giveth us in many points a goodly light: yet therwithal may we plainly ſee, whether we caſt our eies to our underſtanding, or to our wil, that it is not able to ſerve our turn. In the eie or judgement of man (I grant) we may by the vertu of it, and the ordinarie working of God therwithal, not only live in ſeemly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but alſo, now and then give foorth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare and excellent vertues. But before the judgement-ſeat of God, whatſoever ſuch things are found in us, be they never ſo fair, yet could they not there be able to ſtand.</p>

               <p n="6">6 The caſe being ſo with us al,
<note place="margin">This want in the Iſraelits holpen by the written law.</note> it pleaſed God to caſt a ſpecial favor to one people, whom we cal the Iſraelites, and a principal part of them, the Iewes: and unto this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by his written law, to give a ſufficient ſupply, for whatſoever wanted in them by defect of that natural inſtinct or ſenſe of ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. This I ſay he gave unto them: but not unto others. He gave unto them a more certain light: but ſtil left others unto their thik, and duskiſh miſts. And now doth it appertain unto us, to endevor our ſelves, that as we have ſeen what they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others, wherin others had as much as they: ſo now to find out what it was, wherin they had that their ſpecial help, and in reſpect wherof others came ſo ſhort of them.

As touching which, although the laws that to this purpoſe do appertain, are manie and divers, and ſo little digeſted to any plain method, that ſome have omitted to treat of them, and thoſe that write of them, do not handle them al alike: yet me think there may be very wel ſuch a method conceived of them, as that we may therby ſufficiently perceive what was the form or maner of government that was in thoſe

When God did firſt ſet in hand with the deliverance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Aegypt, and told Moſes that now he would no longer ſuffer his people to be

<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 1: 20-22.</note> When (after that once they were delivered) they came ſo far in the wildernes, that now they were at the borders of the land, and being incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Moſes, then to make their entry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have ſearchers ſent before (very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochful, &amp; therfore injurious to the word of God, that could not now be beleeved of them, without the approbation of man; and therfore immediately afterward woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily puniſhed in it ſelfe) although of thoſe ſearchers, being but twelve in al, no fewer than ten of them diſcouraged the people ſo much as to hope ever to get it, for that their enimies were ſo mightie, and had ſo marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fortified themſelves: yet
<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 13: 27</note> could they not denie, but that the land it ſelfe was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous fruitful, as alſo they brought of the fruits therof in witnes of it. So likewiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of their pilgrimage, when Moſes would take (as we ſay) his leave of the people, or bid them farewel, as he put them in mind of the law of God, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon them to walk therafter, ſo, to the end they might better perceive that they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7445:14"/>ſhould not leeſe their labor, but were wel hired therunto,
<note n="d" place="margin">Deu. 8: 7-9.</note> he doth in like maner put them in mind how notable a land the Lord had provided for them:
<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 11: 10-12.</note> another maner of thing than was Aegypt, which ſom of them did ſo much condemn. For that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Aegypt were fain ſomtimes to water their land themſelves, with their own bodily labor: wheras this was watered without the labor of man, with the ſweet and ſeaſonable ſhowers of heaven from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and with plentie of ſprings and rivers beneath. Again, that the Lord had a ſpecial care of that land, and that his eies were therupon from the one end of the yeer to the other. And therfore, that they ſhould there have plentie of wheat, and barly; wine, and olives; pomgranats, and figs: with iron, and braſſe in great abundance. And to the better teſtification therof, and to keepe up a perpetual memorie therof, he alſo taught them,
<note n="f" place="margin">Deu. 26: 9.</note> ſo oft as they ſhould come with their firſt fruits unto the Lord, ever in plain words to confeſſe unto the Lord, that indeed they had received of him a notable good land. To be ſhort, when afterward the people had diverſly offended the Lord, and therfore wel deſerved to have their land barren, and houſes deſolate, nevertheles, even after the enimies, whom they called in with their ſin, had fowly defaced it,

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7445:15"/>then doth God term it to be, a land that floweth with milk and honie, and that is a pleaſant land among al others.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But notwithſtanding the excellencie of this land,

                  </note> they were by Moſes given to underſtand, that they ſhould ever have poore among them. Which might be in the judgment of ſom, a ſore blemiſh to the land it ſelfe: as though it could not be of that fertilitie, when as divers of the inhabitants therof ſhould be ſo needie. Howbeit expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it ſelfe doth teach us, that though any countrie do never ſo much abound with al things needful: yet may divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons that live therin, be very needie.
<note place="margin">Cauſes of povertie.</note> And me think there are three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal fountains, out of which the want or ſtraightnes that the poore are in, doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſpring. Firſt of al, if themſelves be unthriftie, and waſtfully ſpend thoſe good bleſſings that God hath given them. For then it is no marvel, nor any ſtrange matter, if God that cannot abide to ſee his goods ſo waſtfully ſpent take the occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof from ſuch, and beſtow them on others. He would have his houſhold ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal releeved: he would not have his goods beſtowed to the contentation of ſin, or vanitie. Again, ſom there are, that cannot be content to have the uſe of ſuch things themſelves, and then to let them paſſe on,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7445:15"/>in that ſame courſe that the wiſdom of God hath provided: but muſt alſo be medling in turning them to go, after their time, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves think good. So co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe oft times, that while they are ſo buſie in diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing others (though yet unborn) from the intereſt that otherwiſe they had, themſelves alſo by the judgements of God worthily leeſe that, which otherwiſe they might ſtil have enjoied. For he that cannot quietly ſuffer, ſuch as God appointeth, to have the reverſion, give juſt occaſion to God; to take from him his abuſed poſſeſſion. Himſelfe therfore, in both theſe caſes, may be the fountain of al his povertie. The ſecond fountain is in others. As namely, when there is no ſufficient order taken, either for the diſtribution of theſe earthly things; or for the ſober and moderate ſpending of them; or for al to ſettle themſelves to ſom godly labor. For if there be no order taken for the diſtribution of theſe things, then, when as the mightier wil have what they can, the weaker muſt needs have little to live on. So likewiſe, ſeeing that God is not overſeen in the making of his proviſion, &amp; therfore hath not provided things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but ſo far as our need requireth (and yet in ſuch ſort, as that his allowance is very liberal) how can it otherwiſe be, but that if ſom do waſtfully ſpend much more than
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7445:16"/>their allowance commeth unto, others muſt needs want it in theirs? Even ſo alſo may we conclude of the third member of this, that wheras theſe earthly things cannot be applied to our uſe, but by the induſtrie and labor of man; and God doth ſo little allow of idlenes in any, that he may not be thought ſo to have ordeined man, that as the labor of the ſtronger may wel be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the want that is in the weaker, ſo the labor of one may releeve himſelfe &amp; others, I wot not how many: how can it be, if but ſom be laborers, and yet al allowed to be feeders, and the idle perſon to have his ſhare in al things needful as wel as the laborer, but that, bicauſe the labor of few is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain themſelves &amp; many others idle, many muſt needs be very ſore ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by this? The third fountain of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is neither in our ſelves nor others: but only in the good wil and pleaſure of God. Who not only by theſe, but alſo by his own hand divers wais beſides, doth oft times claſp about our neks this yoke of povertie. And that ſometimes, to put us in mind of ſom offence of ours, wherunto ſuch a kind of fatherly diſcipline doth fitly appertain; as the injuring of others, prodigalitie, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or ſuch like: ſomtimes, that rich men may have on whom to beſtow thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, that they have in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7445:16"/>ſomtimes, to make us more wearie of this earthly tabernacle, and more glad to come to the heavenly: and ſomtimes for divers other cauſes that he keepeth unto himſelfe unknown unto us. So that we may be bold to conclude, that notwithſtanding this povertie that ſhould be among them, yet may it wel ſtand therwithal, that the land it ſelfe did abundantly yeeld whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was needful for every one: and that, not after a ſparing maner, but after that moſt liberal allowance that God approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and moſt becommeth his gratious goodnes.</p>
               <p n="11">11 So having ſeen what the land was;
<note place="margin">How they had to make their entrie into this land.</note> by what means it is commonly called; and of what valure it was to the ſuſtenance of thoſe that ſhould dwel therin: we may wel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſearch out, in what ſort it was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them. Which me think may then ſufficiently appeer, if we ſhal find out theſe two things. How they ſhuld at the firſt make it theirs; and in what maner they ſhould poſſeſſe or hold it. Vnto the former of theſe doth appertain both their entrie at the firſt, and the diviſion therof that after inſued. The maner of their entrie and getting the land into their hands, was not to challenge it by diſcent, or any ſuch title; but by a kind of purchaſe: and yet not with monie, or monie woorth; but only by the dint of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7445:17"/>ſword, I mean, by conqueſt. Howbeit, this ſame was done in ſuch ſort, as that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles they had no juſt cauſe to imagin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they got it by their own proweſſe, but only by the power and might of God: or that he gave it them for their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes ſake, and not only of his meer goodnes towards them. For this cauſe doth Moſes firſt
<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 8: 17, 18. &amp; 9: 4-6.</note> wil them to take heed of both thoſe errors, before that ever they come therunto. But to make the matter more plain, in what ſort they had to make their entrie by conqueſt, firſt let us ſee what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or particular charge they had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame; then how they did put it in execution. Their charge was
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 23: 32, 33. &amp; 34: 12-17. Num. 33: 50-56. Deu. 7: 1-6, 16, 25, 26.</note> that they ſhould in no wiſe have any frindſhip or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie; nor make any marriages; nor ſo much as be in leag, or make any peace, not only, not with the idols of that countrie (or to have any reverence of them) but alſo with none of the people therof: but that they ſhould be at utter enmitie with them al, til they had put out their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from the face of the earth, that they ſhould break down their images, cut down their groves, overthrow their altars, and not ſo much as covet the gold, or any ſuch thing as therunto belonged; and as touching the people, that they ſhould have no pittie on them, but deſtroy them al, man,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7445:17"/>woman, and child. And to the end they might the more faithfully execute this judgement of God, as they are alſo given to underſtand
<note n="c" place="margin">Deu. 9: 5.</note> that the ſins of the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this ſharp vengeance, that they may perceive themſelves to be executioners of the righteous judgements of God: ſo they have their eies cheefly turned to another cauſe that might kindle their harts more earneſtly againſt them, ſeeing that it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (ſo neer as it did) their own eſtate and welfare. As namely, that if they did join in marriage or amitie with them, or but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to dwel in the land, they would intice them to their idols, and ſo pluk upon them the vengeance of God: and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles themſelves ever ſeek to diſquiet them to the uttermoſt of their power; and be, as it were thorns in their eies, and ſpears in their ſides, to keep them in continual and bitter vexation, as in thoſe places before ſet down, ſufficiently appeereth.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The execution of this their charge,
<note place="margin">This charge of theirs was not ſo truly executed by them.</note> was not in al points very wel performed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like for that they thought it was very ſtreit or rigorous; and dowted therwithal, it would be ſo odious to al thoſe countries that joined therunto, that therby they might pluk them al upon them, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to lay their powers togither, in like ſort to deſtroy them from the face of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7445:18"/>the earth, that without mercie had deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ancient a people. For worldly policie doth in ſuch caſes praevail very much with fleſh and blood. Nevertheles, that we may ſee in what ſort they did order this matter, ſo far as they medled therwith, firſt of al they began to take poſſeſſion of their land, when on the eaſt ſide of Iordan they had
<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 21: 21-35. Deu. 2: 26-37. &amp; 3: 1-11.</note> ſubdued Sehon king of the Ammorites, and Og the king of Baſan, and tooke thoſe countries unto themſelves. At which time we find very good likelihood, that they did fully execute the charge committed unto them. For ſeeing we read
<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 2: 34. &amp; 3: 6.</note> that they did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy them, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that God ſo far approoveth their dealing with Sehon, that he
<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 21: 34</note> maketh it a patern for them to follow in their dealing with Og, and miſliketh nothing (that we read of) in either of both: it muſt needs be a very good conjecture (if not a ſufficient proofe) that they deſtroied their idols alſo, and did whatſoever els was to be done, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a faithful, and zealous maner. But imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after this, before that ever they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iordan to the other ſide of the land, by the reaſon that
<note n="d" place="margin">Ioſ. 2: 1-21. &amp; 6: 22, 23.</note> a certain woman that kept victualing, Rahab by name, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Iericho, did keep ſecret a couple of men that Ioſuah had ſent to ſearch the land, both thoſe men did ſwear unto hir, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7445:18"/>they would ſave hir, and hir houſhold harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and the whole armie after they came in, performed the ſame. After this they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the land, and being victorious; did very wel (for ought we ſee to the contrarie) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their charge: themſelves entering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſſeſſion of the land ever as they got it; and rooting out the old inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and their idols with them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<note n="e" place="margin">Ioſ. 7: 1-26.</note> one man Acham by name, did through covetouſnes grevouſly tranſgreſſe; and though the wrath of God was therby ſo ſharply provoked, that he did puniſh the whole multitude by making them flie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their enimies: yet neither was it but one mans treſpaſſe, neither did the whole congregation leave it unpuniſhed. How beit, not long after
<note n="f" place="margin">Ioſ. 9: 3-15.</note> both Ioſuah himſelfe and the reſt of the princes, did commit a foul overſight, contrarie to the charge that the Lord had given them. For when as the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Gibeonites (who were of that people, that the Lord had appointed them to deſtroy) came with a ſubtil practice, to get a leag of peace at the hands of the Iſraelites, praetending themſelves to be of another nation, far diſtant from the land of Canaan, and that they came to be in leag with them, for the great things that they heard to be done by them: then the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were ſo fully perſuaded by that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7445:19"/>homly pollicie of the Gibeonites, that they were indeed as they praetended, that, forgetting to aske counſel of the mouth of the Lord, or els counting the ſame but needles in ſo plain a matter as they ſuppoſed it to have been, they unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly entered into the leag with them. They were as wiſe men, as others are: and yet in this did they very fouly overſhoote themſelves. But ſuch is the wiſdom of fleſh and blood, when it regardeth not the word of the Lord, but wil venture to go by it ſelf. But this was but a ſmal ſlip, to ſpeak of, in compariſon of that which followed: and beſides that, it was immediately after ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amended by themſelves. For after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they did indeed conquer the whole land, and
<note n="g" place="margin">Ioſ. 12: 24.</note> ſlu in al, one and thirtie kings. But, having once gotten the feeld of al their enimies; and having driven them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, to their holds;
<note n="h" place="margin">Iudg. 2: 10.</note> Ioſuah alſo and the good elders being fallen aſleep,
<note n="i" place="margin">Iud. 1: 20-35</note> then began they generally to ſpare their enimies: and, either to let them quietly injoy many of their cities without moleſtation, or at the leaſt, only to make them tributaries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Inſomuch that
<note n="k" place="margin">Iud. 2: 1-5.</note> the Lord did both ſharply rebuke them for it: and beſides that, did plainly give them to underſtand, that ſeeing they had ſo done, he alſo would now have peace with them, &amp; have them to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7445:19"/>live in the land, to the great and perpetual moleſtation of the Iſraelites that would not deſtroy them when they might. At which ſorrowful newes though the Iſraelites wept ſo bitterly, that therby they gave the name of the place: yet was it too late, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe that ſentence of the Lord, which they ſhould have foreſeen before. And ſo by their ſluggiſhnes it was fulfilled, which the Lord before had ſpoken, that
<note n="l" place="margin">Exo. 23: 28-30. Deu. 7: 22.</note> he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them at once, leaſt the land ſhould grow to a wildernes, and the beaſts of the feeld riſe up againſt them: as afterward al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he giveth them to underſtand,
<note n="m" place="margin">Iud. 2: 22. &amp; 3: 2, 4.</note> that they ſhuld be to ſom uſe unto them, that is, to proove them whether they would obey the Lord, and keep faſt to his wais; and to teach them feats of arms.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Concerning the diviſion or diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this land,

Iaacob, whom it pleaſed God to term
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 32: 28 &amp; 35: 10.</note> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, that is, praevailing with God, being the ſon of Iſaac, which was the ſon of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, had, as it is wel inough known unto al, twelve
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 29, &amp; 30, &amp; 35: 22-26.</note> ſons: Ruben, Simeon, Levie, Iudah, Dan, Nepthalie, Gad, Aſer, Iſachar,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7445:20"/>Zabulon, Ioſeph and Benjamin. Out of which his twelve ſons it pleaſed GOD to raiſe a mightie people, which are called (of Iſrael himſelf, the father of theſe twelve) the children of Iſrael, as who ſhould ſay, that people that hath found favor with God, as indeed they had ſpecially done. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that race of people that came of everie one of theſe ſons of Iaacob, were termed the
<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 1. Apoc. 7: 5-8.</note> tribe of him, of whom they diſcended. As the race or ſtok of Ruben, was called the tribe of Ruben: the familie or kindred of Iudah, was termed the tribe of Iudah: and ſo the reſt. Now it pleaſed GOD, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he praeſcribed unto them a ſet form of religion, which was immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deliverance out of Aegypt, what time they had now been the people of God 430. yeers, and were grown to about
<note n="d" place="margin">Exo. 12: 37.</note> 600000. men, beſides women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: then (I ſay) it pleaſed God to

<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 48: 5.</note> Iaacob, as he lay on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in Aegypt, had taken unto him the two ſons of Ioſeph (which were Manaſſes and Ephraim) as his own, and ſo making two tribes of Ioſeph, had made thirteen in al: the Lord thus taking the Levites out, did

Firſt to ſearch out what was given or allotted to thoſe twelve tribes, Ruben, Simeon, Iudah, Dan, Nephtalie, Gad, Aſer, Iſachar, Zabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Ephraim, Manaſſes, and Benjamin: and then, what was given to the tribe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, whom the Lord had exempted from the reſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Vnto the twelve tribes,
<note place="margin">What was the portion of the twelve tribes.</note> the whole land was by God himſelfe appointed to be given: and that by lot, for the avoiding of contention, that otherwiſe might have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen about that matter. Howbeit, this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution was not ſo praeciſely obſerved, but that two tribes and a halfe, that is, the tribes of Ruben, and Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manaſſes, praeventing their lot in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, got a portion to be aſſigned to them. For ſo ſoone as the children of Iſrael had conquered thoſe two kings aforeſaid on the eaſt ſide of Iordan, before that ever as yet they had entred the land of Canaan,
<note n="a" place="margin">Nu. 32: 1-42</note> theſe two tribes, &amp; halfe the other, liking that countrie wel, deſired Moſes that the ſame might ſtand for their lot, and ſo would they be content without any more on the other ſide. Moſes therfore, taking them bound, that they ſhould nevertheles go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with their brethren, and help them to

Again, they divided among themſelves the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that the Lord had bounded foorth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: not only thoſe cities which they had alreadie conquered; but thoſe alſo that were yet in their enimies hands. And ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed al the tribes to repair to their own private inheritance, and to conquer their hom-enimies, ſuch as remained within the lot or poſſeſſion of everie one.</p>

So far

For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two ſorts, had as it were a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral portion. The common ſort of Levites, or generally the whole multitude of them were appointed to have for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 18: 20, 23. Deu. 10: 8, 9. &amp; 18: 1-5.</note> no part at al among their brethren: but only,
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 27: 30. Nu. 18: 21, 24 Deu. 14: 22, 27 &amp; 12: 19.</note> the tenth part of al the increaſe or profits that the land did yeeld any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way; and, out of every tribe, a certain number of
<note n="c" place="margin">Nu. 35: 1-15</note> cities with their ſuburbs to dwel in, to the number of eight and fortie in al. Their cities were ſo taken out from among the reſt, that thoſe which had manie gave mo, and thoſe which had fewer gave accordingly: and the Levites were ſo ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered throughout the land, that the people might everie-where be better taught. The ſuburbs that their cities were allowed to have, to find their cattel withal, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be two thouſand cubits, or halfe a mile foorth-right fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wals of the citie round about: ſo that although God gave them no ſuch portion as he gave to the other: yet conſidering that ech of them had but a twelfe part, and theſe a tenth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7445:22"/>part, beſides their cities, with their ſuburbs, it is evident, that by Gods ordinance they had a much better part; at leaſt, ſo long, as the number of them did not much exceed themſelves as they were now, for that they were the feweſt in number of al the other tribes. Alſo the maner of paieng this tith was ſuch, that
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 27: 32, 33.</note> it was not lawful for them to put by a better, and to put in a woorſe in ſteed therof: but to pay the ſame that fel out to be the tenth, whether it were better or woorſe. And
<note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 27: 31.</note> though the place were far, ſo that they would rather covet to give the valu of it in monie, than the thing it ſelfe in kind: yet might they not ſo do, but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a fift part more therunto; ſo to put by ſuch colluſion, as therupon might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ariſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Vnto the preeſts that were occupied in the miniſtration,
<note place="margin">What was the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preests.</note> a more liberal portion was du: which aroſe unto them two maner of wais. Wherof the former is the ſame that reſpecteth their ordinarie commodities: the other, that which reſpecteth certain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinarie fees or avails. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie commoditie (beſides
<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 18: 8.</note> that which otherwiſe any of them might have of his own) conſiſted principally in three things: wherof the firſt is the tenth or tith that they had of that tenth or tith which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites received of the Iſraelits. For as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7445:22"/>were allowed to take tith of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Iſraelites: ſo
<note n="b" place="margin">Num. 18: 25, 26.</note> were they charged to pay over the tith of the ſame to the preeſts. The ſecond ſort of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities as were ordinarie
<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 18: 8, 9, 11, 19, 30, 31 Num. 5: 8-10.</note> were thoſe meaſures, and parts of al ſuch things as were brought unto the Lord for oblations and ſacrifices, which was according to the nature of the ſacrifice (of which afterward we have to ſpeak) either a certain quantitie of corn, flower, wine, or oile; or elſe
<note n="d" place="margin">Nu. 18: 18. Deut. 18: 3.</note> certain porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the beaſt ſacrificed. The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that the people were bound to bring unto the Lord, which the preeſts by his appointment were to have, the firſt of al that it pleaſed God to bleſſe them withal. Wherof there were two ſorts: one of
<note n="e" place="margin">Num. 18: 15-18. Le. 27.</note> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures as they fel, both man, and beaſt: yet in ſuch ſort, that both men-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the increaſe of unclean beaſts ſhould by a certain price be redeemed the other, of the
<note n="f" place="margin">Num. 18: 12, 13. Deu. 18: 4.</note> fruits that the land every yeer doth yeeld: which at a certain time, and before they tooke therof to their own uſe, they ſhould bring to the preeſts, as after followeth. Their extraordinarie avails I term thoſe fees, that were du unto them, out of the vowes that the people would oft times extraordinarily make of their own accord. Which were ſomtimes of ſom kind of oblation;
<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 27: 11-22. Nu. 18: 14.</note> and ſomtimes of ſom other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7445:23"/>bleſſings that God had given them:
<note n="h" place="margin">Le. 27: 1-8.</note> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe, of themſelves, or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Out of which lightly
<note n="i" place="margin">Nu. 18: 8. Lev. 27: 1-25.</note> ſom commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie came unto them, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the vow. So likewiſe,
<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 5: 8.</note> if one man had treſpaſſed againſt another, and then purpoſed with himſelfe to reſtore it again with a fift part more added therunto, as the law required, and could not find neither the partie himſelfe alive, nor any of his kin to receive it, that alſo ſhould he bring to the preeſt, beſides his ſacrifice for that treſpas.</p>

So that until we ſee, in what ſort they have to live therin, and how their treſpaſſes are by the ſentence of God to be puniſhed, we are not able fully to find out what is to be ſaid of this matter. Nevertheles, ſom laws there are (but thoſe very few) that may be taken apart from the others, and properly concern this praeſent matter. Poſſeſſion reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in theſe two things: in lands, &amp; goods. Concerning lands, ſom of the laws that I ſpeak of concern the holding of lands: and ſom, the redeeming of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Concerning the former, firſt we have to note in what ſort they are appointed to deſcend: then how
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7445:23"/>afterward they are to hold the ſame both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards their neighbor. How they ſhould deſcend, is cheefly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon occaſion that
<note n="a" place="margin">Nu. 27: 1-11</note> Zalphaad one of the tribe of Manaſſes, had no ſons but only five daughters, that at his departure he left behind him. For by that occaſion it came in quaeſtion, and was decided by the mouth of God, that in al ſuch caſes, if a man had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſon, the ſame ſhould be accounted his heir: if he had no ſon, then his daughter: if he had no daughter, then his brother: if no brother, his fathers brother: if no ſuch uncle, then the next of his kin whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. So likewiſe doth he els-where deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, that, if upon ſom il perſuaſion of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wife,
<note n="b" place="margin">Deu. 21: 15-17.</note> a man would diſhaerit his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſon by a former wife, to make the ſon of the ſecond his heir: yet may he not ſo do, but leave the birth-right unto the eldeſt. Nevertheles, we read that Ruben, for
<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 35: 22. 49: 3, 4. &amp; 1. Par. 5: 1.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing his fathers bed,
<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 49: 4. 1. Par. 5: 1.</note> was put from his birth-right, being the eldeſt; and Ioſeph and Iudah taken into his room. That which concerneth the maner of their hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, is only that law, that was of a certain
<note n="e" place="margin">De. 26: 1-10</note> homage, that every yeer they were commanded to do unto the Lord, for ſuch lands as they held of him. Which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to bring of their firſt fruits unto the Lord, and there to confeſſe that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7445:24"/>God had praeſerved their fathers and them from time to time, and been marvelous gracious unto them: that he had given them that good land as before he promiſed, that they did now injoy the ſame, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought of the fruits therof unto him. A notable tenure: and ſuch as diſgraceth many of ours, that were notwithſtanding deviſed and appointed by notable men, as then they were taken. Wherunto may be added, that
<note n="f" place="margin">Ex. 23: 10, 11 Lev. 25: 1-11.</note> every ſeventh yeer, and in the Iubile, they ſhould ſuffer their land to reſt: ſo to teach them, to moderate their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on that behalfe; to depend on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God; and not utterly to wear out the ſoil that was given them. That which concerneth the maner of their hold towards men, was that they might have it ſeveral: and yet not ſo; but that the poore, and generally al, might ſomtimes have ſom uſe therof. That they might have it ſeveral, it appeereth both by the partition that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſpoken of: and in this alſo, that
<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 22: 6.</note> if any ſhould with his cattel eate up, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hurt his neighbors feelds, he ſhould make good the ſame again, with the beſt of his own. That the poore, and others gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally might notwithſtanding have ſom uſe therof, it appeereth in this, that ſo oft as the land ſhould reſt without any husbandry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on it
<note n="h" place="margin">Exo. 23: 11. Lev. 25: 4-7.</note> ſuch things as it yeelded of it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7445:24"/>ſelfe, ſhould be common: and
<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 23: 24, 25.</note> that when it was ſeveral, any paſſing by the way, might take and eat of the fruits of the ground to ſerve his need, ſo that he carried none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p n="18">18 As for redeeming of land that once was gone from the ancient owners,
<note place="margin">Of redeming their lands.</note> two laws there are, that belong therunto. The one reſtoreth lands hom again generally to al: the other reſtoreth them but unto ſom. The law which reſtoreth lands hom unto al, is double, wherof one is the law of Iubile. Which was, that if any through po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie or unthriftines had ſold his lands or any part therof
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 25: 10, 13, 28.</note> yet in the yeer of Iubile, which was every fiftith yeer, thoſe lands ſhould return again, either to him, if he were alive, or els to his heirs if he were dead. The other, that which is ſet down in expreſſe words,
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 25: 24.</note> that no lands ſhal be bought, but with clauſe of redemption. That is, that he that ſelleth muſt ever have libertie to bie his lands again, ſo that it be within the time appointed. That law which is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, iſſueth out of the latter of theſe, and it ſelfe alſo is double: firſt as it reſpecteth al other Iſraelites; then as it reſpecteth the Levites only. That which reſpecteth al other Iſraelites hath two principal members. For firſt as touching land generally,
<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 25: 25-27.</note> if a man ſel it to his neighbor, either himſelfe, or the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7445:25"/>next of his kin may redeem it again: and, for ſo much leſſe than the other gave, as the commoditie (that ſince he bought it, he did receive) amounteth unto. So likewiſe
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 27: 16-21.</note> if he vow to the Lord any part of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeritance, he may redeem it again, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fift part (as the preeſt ſhal valu it) therunto: but if he ſhrink from his vow, and ſel it to ſom other, then, after the next Iubile, it commeth to the preeſts for ever. If the land that he voweth were purchaſed of another, then though he ſhronk, yet was not the land to be forfeited, but
<note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 27: 22-24.</note> the valu only to be du to the Lord: and the land it ſelfe was to return after the Iubile, to the ancient owner. Then alſo, as touching the ſale of an houſe, the law was, that
<note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 25: 29, 30.</note> if the houſe were in a walled citie, the ſeller ſhould not have libertie to redeem it, but the ſpace of one whole yeer, and that it ſhould never again return to the ancient owner, if in one yeer, he, or ſom for him, did not redeem it. But
<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 25: 31</note> if it were out of a walled citie, then it ſhould follow the nature of the common lands. That which reſpecteth only the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites doth not a little varie from the other. For firſt
<note n="h" place="margin">Lev. 25: 34</note> as touching the little land that they had to the ſuburbs of their 48. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that might in no wiſe be ſold. Then alſo as touching
<note n="i" place="margin">Lev. 25: 32, 33.</note> their houſes whether they were in walled cities, or not, both they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7445:25"/>might be at al times redeemed; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the yeer of Iubile they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Concerning the poſſeſſing of their goods, I ſee little ſet down,
<note place="margin">Of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leinage.</note> but that may be better referred to one of thoſe parts that follow. One thing only there is, that doth more properly appertain unto this. Which is, that they were allowed to have (that which ſeemeth ſomwhat hard among us) villans or bondmen, as their proper goods. As touching which matter, a few laws there are: both concerning their eſtate in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and concerning their manumiſſion, or the infranchiſing, or freeing of them. Firſt as touching
<note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 21: 2-6. De. 15: 12-17.</note> an Hebrew, though they bought him of others, yet could they not compel him to ſerve but ſix yeers, and muſt needs let him go free the ſeventh, both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his, if he came with wife or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Howbeit, that if the ſervant would not then part with his maſter, his maſter might then keep him for ever. So likewiſe, if any man ſhould bie a bondwoman, ſhe ſhould have the ſame law. This alſo beſides, that
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 21: 8, 10 Deut. 21: 14.</note> if he ſhould promiſe hir marriage, though afterward he miſliked hir before he married hir, yet ſhould he give hir meat, drink, and cloth, and ſuch dowrie as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of marriage required: and might not ſel hir to any other. So likewiſe, that
<note n="c" place="margin">Exo. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7445:26"/>ſhould promiſe hir to his ſon, and afterward repented: yet ſhould he do unto hir, as to one of his daughters. Els for default of ſuch duties, that ſhe ſhould be therby infranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Over their villans or bondmen that were not of their own nation, they had ſuch libertie allowed them, as then was in ure in thoſe countries. Inſomuch that they might keep them ever: and
<note n="d" place="margin">Exo. 21: 20, 21.</note> though they beat them ſo ſore, that within few dais after they died, in divers caſes they were not to be charged therwith. Other laws alſo there be of ſuch matters: but ſuch as, I think, wil better agree to that which followeth.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Concerning the other,
<note place="margin">Of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie generally.</note> that is, their behavior in the land that God had given them, we have to conſider two principal things: what was the direction that they had to frame their lives by; and in what ſort their faults and tranſgreſſions were to be puniſhed. In the former of which, that is, in what ſort they ſhould lead their lives, there are two principal things to be conſidered: firſt, what direction they had as touching their private life at hom; then, what directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they nad as touching the publik exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their religion. The direction that was given them for the more orderly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their private life at hom before God and men, ſomtimes is given in plain ſpeech: and ſomtimes commended unto
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7445:26"/>them by figures, and under the exerciſe of outward obſervations. Both which kinds may beſt be ſorted according to the order of the ten commandements, for that they do compraehend the effect of al, which effect or ſum of al, is in few words no more but this,
<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 20: 3.</note> wholy to give over themſelves to God alone: and from thence to derive unto them theſe two principal parts of that their dutie; to love God above al things, &amp; their neighbor as themſelves. Vnto which love of God they were taught, two ſpecial points to appertain. Firſt, that
<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. 4, 5.</note> they ſhould worſhip him, not as themſelves, or others thought good: but only as himſelfe in his word had required. Then, that they ſhould do it in convenient maner: wherunto appertain two principal points. Firſt, that they ſhould do the ſame
<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. 7.</note> truly, without hypocriſie or diſſimulation: then, that they ſhould be
<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. 8-11.</note> zealous therin, or earneſtly bent therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So likewiſe, that unto the love of their neighbor did appertain other two points: one concerning their doings towards him: the other concerning the moderating of their own affections within. That which reſpecteth their doings towards him, hath two ſpecial points. Firſt, that they ſhould
<note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. 12.</note> reverence ech other, everie one in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and therby knit togither in one, in godlie unitie. Secondly, that they ſhould
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7445:27"/>have ſuch an hartie care to praeſerve ech o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that not only they regard ech others
<note n="f" place="margin">Ibid. 13.</note> life or good eſtate generally, to uphold the ſame: but alſo, that they have a ſpecial care of theſe three points, to praeſerve or leave unto everie one his

<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note> ſubſtance undiminiſhed; and his good name

<note n="k" place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> covet, or that they ſhould ſo content themſelves with their eſtate, that they ſought not to praevent any others in theirs. Howbeit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be the effect of al, yet it ſhal be good to ſee, how the ſame is expreſſed by certain particulars.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Firſt of al therfore concerning their life towards God,
<note place="margin">They must have none other, but him alone.</note> they are commanded to put by al others in heaven and earth, and to have
<note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 20: 3. &amp; 23: 25. De. 5: 7</note> none other God but him alone: nor ſo much as to have in their mouths the
<note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 23: 13. Ioſuah. 23: 7. Pſal. 16: 5.</note> names of any others, or to let them be heard out of their lips. And bicauſe the greateſt danger was either in thoſe that were worſhipped in Aegypt, where the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael had ſojourned ſo long; or in thoſe that were worſhipped of the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and other nations among whom now they ſhould dwel (the one for education ſake; the other for policie:) therfore
<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 18: 2, 3. De. 12: 30, 31.</note> had they a ſpecial warning given to take heed of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7445:27"/>the gods of thoſe countries: and therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al were ſtreightly charged
<note n="d" place="margin">Exo. 23: 24. Deu. 7: 5, 25. &amp; 12: 2, 3.</note> to break down the idols or pictures of them; to overthrow their altars; to cut down their groves; and to let no monument of them to remain. To this end eſpecially it did appertain, that the Lord did ordain certain ſerviſes among them, that ſhould properly ſerve to confirm them in that point: that is, that he only is the Lord; that they were his tenants, and held of them whatſoever they had. Of this ſort there were eſpecially three: that yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him of their firſt born; or of their firſt fruits; and of their tithes. For although there was another end of theſe ordinances, that is, that the miniſterie, and ſuch as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the altar, ſhould live therby: yet to this end alſo were they ordeined, to witnes the ſoveraigntie, that the Lord had over them. The law of the firſt-born was this.
<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 13: 2, 11-16. &amp; 22: 28.34: 19. Num. 18: 15.</note> Whatſoever male did firſt open the womb, whether it was of man, or beaſt, or (as we ſay) was firſt of al born or bred, that ſame did the Lord challenge to be his, and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame to be an ordinance among them: but not al after one maner. For
<note n="f" place="margin">Exo. 13: 13. &amp; 34: 20. Nu. 18: 15, 16.</note> if it were the firſt born of man, it was to be redeemed: and the price was five ſicles of the ſanctuarie, or five ſcore Gerahs (which is al one) amounting to (as it is ſaid) about ſixteen ſhillings and eight pence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7445:28"/>of our coin: though by the weight of the Gerah, which
<note n="g" place="margin">Ioan. Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius in Exod. 30: 13. And Annot. on the B. Bible upon Num. 3: 47. 18: 16.</note> is ſaid to be the weight of ſixteen barly corns, I cannot find that 20. Gerahs (which is the ſicle of the ſanctuarie, double to the other ſicle that is common) do weigh any more than two ſhillings and four pence of our coin, after the rate of five ſhillings the ounce. And then is the ſicle of the ſanctuarie but two ſhillings and four pence: and five ſicles but eleven ſhillings eight pence.
<note n="h" place="margin">Exo. 13: 12. 22: 29. &amp; 34: 19. Num. 18: 17. De. 15: 19, 20.</note> If it were a beaſt that was clean, it might not be redeemed, nor kept bak, nor put to uſe, nor any commoditie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it; but without deceit brought as it was unto the preeſts, as the portion of the Lord after that it had been ſeven dais with the dam.
<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 13: 13. 34: 20. Num. 18: 15.</note> If it were of an unclean beaſt, as of an aſſe, that alſo was the Lords: but it was to be redeemed with a lamb. Nevertheles, the party was not bound to redeem it, as he was to redeem his firſt-born ſon: but, if he would not be at the coſt to redeem it, then muſt he cut off the head therof; and was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. So likewiſe the firſt-born of a clean beaſt, if it had any deformitie or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, then, although in that caſe alſo it was the Lords: yet
<note n="k" place="margin">Deu. 15: 21-23.</note> were they diſcharged for bringing it unto the ſanctuarie or temple of the Lord, there to make merrie or feaſt therwithal before him (as
<note n="l" place="margin">Deu. 15: 19, 20.</note> they were bound to do with ſuch as were without
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7445:28"/>blemiſh) and were willed to eat it at hom, and to hold feaſt therwithal unto the Lord in their own houſes. This chalenge that the Lord did make to the firſt-born, exempting them to his own proper uſe, had alſo a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſenſe, that was proper to it ſelfe, beſides thoſe two before recited that are common to both the others. For this was ordeined to this uſe alſo,
<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 13: 14-16.</note> that it might keep in freſh remembrance that notable benefit which the children of Iſrael received of the Lord a little before their departure out of Aegypt: that is, that when the Lord deſtroied the firſt-born of Aegypt, nevertheles he ſpared the firſt-born of al his people. As alſo the Lord did
<note n="n" place="margin">Num. 3: 6, 12, 13, 40-51. &amp; 8: 16-19.</note> afterward uſe it, to quiet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in deducting the whole tribe of Levie out from among them to the uſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie: taking them, and a certain fine by pole of the overplus, for al the firſt-born that then were. Of which to diſcourſe more fully, there is afterward offered better occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Vnto our ſelves, out of this law this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may we take, that ſeeing God is as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to us, we alſo ought to praeſent him with the beſt that we have: and for to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thoſe miſerly practiſes that commonly we uſe, to ſhift him off with the very woorſt that we are able to pik out of the reſt. The offering of the firſt of their fruits that out of the increaſe of the earth did ariſe unto
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7445:29"/>them, was
<note n="o" place="margin">Exo. 22: 28. 23: 19. &amp; 34: 26. Deu. 26: 2. Lev. 19: 24.</note> to the ſelfeſame end ordeined: that is, to witnes, that whatſoever they had, they held only of him. For the firſt of their fruits, they had to offer, both the firſt of corn, and
<note n="p" place="margin">Lev. 23: 10.</note> ſuch things as firſt ripened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and alſo a part of their
<note n="q" place="margin">Num. 15: 18-21.</note> firſt batch of bread. To the end, that they might ever obſerve this ordinance, they were
<note n="r" place="margin">Lev. 23: 14.</note> charged that they ſhould take nothing that their ground did yeeld to their own uſe, until that they had firſt brought ſom ſuch praeſent unto the Lord. And to the end that they might do it more effectually,
<note n="ſ" place="margin">De. 26: 1-11.</note> he teacheth them alſo, when they com to bring him that pręſent, to acknowledge in plain words that it was the Lord, and he alone, that gave unto them that good land: and that by his goodnes they now had the ſame in quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion. As indeed the goodnes of God is ſuch, that it deſerveth to be acknowledged: and, of ſuch things as he giveth, to have ſuch portion as he requireth (eſpecially being ſo ſmal as it is) even at the firſt, and not to tarrie til we our ſelves (after the proportion of our greedie appetite) ſhal be glutted to our own deſire. What the law of tithes was, is before declared. Now I do but admoniſh, that it is one of the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherby God would continually witnes unto them, that he was the Lord, and they his tenants. Which that they might more
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7445:29"/>effectually do,
<note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 26, 12-15.</note> he taught them, that everie third yeer they ſhould make a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation unto the Lord, that they had truly paid al their tithes, that to their knowledge they had not with-held any part therof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſupply their own neceſſitie; or to do any good work which was otherwiſe to be done of their own charges, as to burie the dead, or ſuch like: and that wittingly they had not ſuffered any part of it to periſh by their negligence. And bicauſe this was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined to be every third yeer after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeers reſt to the land, it was a time of al moſt fit to amend ſuch things, as a man had omitted before: for that this yeer was fartheſt of al on both ſides remooved from the ſeventh yeer, wherin the land was to lie common. So that as this law was ordeined to teach them ſinceritie in paieng of their tithes: ſo was this proteſtation appointed then to be made, when they might moſt eaſily do it. What things we omit by the reaſon of ſom urgent neceſſitie that at ſom ſpecial time doth much annoy us, if we have any grace, we make up again ſo ſoone as God doth ſend us plentie. Other things beſides thoſe there are, that preached the ſoveraigntie that God had over his people. But theſe are the cheefeſt in my judgement: &amp; theſe might wel ſuffice to teach them, that he was The Lord their God, that they muſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7445:30"/>abandon al others, &amp; wholy betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto him, to live and die at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Next heerunto it is of them required that having alreadie in ſuch ſort betaken themſelves to him alone,
<note place="margin">They must do unto God nothing els but as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth.</note> as to their onlie tru and living Lord, they ſhould do unto him, not as themſelves, or others think good; but onlie as himſelfe praeſcribeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Vnto which place eſpecially doth appertain the whole form of religion that was given unto them. But bicauſe it is a thing of ſpecial importance in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, therfore I thought good to ſpeak of it apart by it ſelfe: and in this place to ſpeak but of ſuch other duties of this kind, as did not concern the form of their publik reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but were to be obſerved of them al at hom, at al times, and in al places, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerved. Of this ſort were theſe. Firſt of al,
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 18: 1-5. 20: 23. De. 12: 29-31. Deut. 18: 9.</note> that they ſhould in no wiſe behave them ſelves before him, either after the doings of the land of Aegypt, wherin they dwelt; or after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither now he was about to bring them: but ever frame themſelves to do
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 20: 22 Deu. 4: 2. 5: 32, 33. &amp; 12: 32.</note> after his ordinances, judgements, and ſtatutes, in whatſoever they tooke in hand, turning aſide from them neither to the right hand, nor to the left. Inſomuch that although he allow them to make vowes, that is, even of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7445:30"/>their accord to do ſom work unto him, that otherwiſe he doth not urge them unto (which is the thing that of al others is left moſt free unto them:) yet even in that alſo doth he not leave them to their own wils, but directeth them how to proceed, and how to behave themſelves therin. And firſt as touching the perſons that may vow,
<note n="c" place="margin">Nu. 30: 1-17</note> he alloweth but ſuch as are at their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to make any vow. As for yoong women that are in their fathers houſe, and married wives, he alloweth none of their vowes to ſtand, unles the father of the one, and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the other do hear the ſame, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give his conſent unto it, or at leaſt do not gain-ſay it. Then concerning the things vowed, if afterward they were not diſpoſed to give the very thing that they vowed, or could not conveniently bring it thither where it ſhould be delivered, or if it were ſuch as was not to be offered, he teacheth them how to redeem whatſoever they vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being of that nature, that it could not bein the very kind it ſelfe performed. For otherwiſe, if a man did vow
<note n="d" place="margin">Le. 27: 9, 10.</note> any ſuch thing, that was not to be redeemed by monie, but to be paid as we ſay in kind: inſomuch, that if any ſhould put to by a better to give a woorſe, he ſhould then give both. As alſo on the other ſide, ſom things were ſo dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, as the price of whoordom, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</p>
            </div>
            <div n="50-100" type="part">
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7445:31"/>
               <p>gotten by bauderie; and ſom things ſo vile and of ſo ſmal account, as the price or valu of a dog; and ſom things ſo fully the Lords already, as the firſt-born, that
<note n="e" place="margin">Deu. 23: 18. Lev. 27: 26.</note> no vow to the Lord might be made of them. But the things, that once being vowed, might be by the parties again redeemed, were ſuch as might not be offered in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and yet might be given unto the Lord to ſom other good purpoſe. As namely, mankind; the common ſort of unclean beaſts; houſes; and land. Of which only mankind had the price ſet: the reſt were to be taxed by the preeſt. The price or rate of the redemption of man, was according to his ſex, and yeers: and that after this maner.
<note n="f" place="margin">Le. 27: 3-7.</note> A man-child vowed, being betwixt a moneth and five yeers old, was priced at five ſhekels: from five, to twentie, at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhekels: from twentie yeers old to three ſcore, to fiftie: from three ſcore upward to fifteen. A woman-child of the firſt compas of age, to three ſhekels: of the ſecond, to ten: of the third, to thirtie; and of the fourth, to ten.
<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 27: 8.</note> Saving only that a proviſo is had for ſuch as were not able to pay after this rate, that the preeſt might at his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take it down to their abilitie. As for the
<note n="h" place="margin">Lev. 27: 11-25.</note> other three, the preeſt had to ſet the rate according to his diſcretion. But in theſe things this was to be obſerved, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7445:31"/>although any others might bie them at the price that the preeſt did ſet,
<note n="i" place="margin">Lev. 27: 13, 15, 19, 27.</note> yet might not the owner himſelfe ſo redeem them, but by adding a fift part more. And this is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the law of vowes, ſo much as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to this praeſent purpoſe. Wherby we may ſee, that although God would take at their hands a work of their own: yet, that it might not be any other, but ſuch as was ſubject to the direction that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. So far is it from him, to accept any thing in good part, that is not his. And to the end that they might not fear to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any lak, being ſo abſolutely put by al others, and ſo praeciſely kept only to the bek of God, it is farther to their comfort declared, firſt, that thoſe
<note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 4: 6-8. 6: 23.</note> ſtatutes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are of marvelous aequitie and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: then, that a ſufficient prophet ſhal be ſent unto them, both
<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 23: 20-23.</note> to guide them in the wildernes until they com to their promiſed reſt, and to
<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 18: 15-19.</note> make known unto them the way of health: laſt of al, both what
<note n="n" place="margin">Le. 26: 3-13 Deu. 28: 1-14.</note> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes appertaineth to thoſe that obſerve them; and what
<note n="o" place="margin">Lev. 26: 14-41. Deut. 28: 15-68.</note> miſerie hangeth over the graceleſſe heads of thoſe that care not for them. Then, beſides that kind of general prohibition of al other wais, he toucheth certain of thoſe by name, of which he would have them eſpecially to beware. Of which ſort, although the moſt of them may better
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7445:32"/>be digeſted to other places as more proper to them: yet ſom of them are ſuch, as do not only challenge this place as meeteſt for them; but alſo may give ſufficient light, how careful it ſtood them in hand to be, to take heed of that countrie infection, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the direction that God did give them. As namely, firſt that they ſhould in no wiſe bow down to the
<note n="p" place="margin">Exo. 23: 24. Deut. 12: 1-4.</note> images of thoſe nations, nor
<note n="q" place="margin">Exo. 20: 23. Lev. 19: 3. Deu. 4: 15-19.</note> have any of their own, of what maner or likenes ſoever, nor ſo much as
<note n="r" place="margin">Lev. 16: 1.</note> a piller to looke upon. So likewiſe that they ſhould not
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Lev. 17: 7.</note> offer unto divels:

               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Concerning the maner of doing this dutie in ſuch ſort as is required, the firſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7445:32"/>point of it was to walk before God in al ſinceritie and ſinglenes of mind, and in no thing to behave themſelves otherwiſe than became their holie calling. And there were two ſorts of praecepts that did appertain heerunto. Thoſe I account of the firſt ſort,
<note place="margin">Generally of al.</note> that generally appertain unto al: and ſuch of the ſecond, as do ſpecially appertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſom, by the vertu of ſom ſpecial profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are in. Concerning the former ſort, firſt of al it is plainly forbidden, to
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 19: 12.</note> uſe the name of God in matters of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; or, any way to pollute his holie name: and required, that they
<note n="b" place="margin">Leu. 20: 7, 8.</note> ſanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be holie in al their doings. Then alſo, the ſame care that they ought to have of ſanctifieng the Lord, is commended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by divers figures. As namely,
<note n="c" place="margin">De. 23: 1-8.</note> that a maimed perſon, or a baſtard of a common harlot, or an Ammonite, or a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abite (for that they did not releeve the children of Iſrael as they paſſed by, towards their land of promiſe) might not enter into the congregation of the Lord; nor the Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maean, nor the Aegyptian neither, til the third generation. So likewiſe among the people themſelves, and the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſame one with another, divers caſes there were, wherin they had to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves unclean, and to withdraw themſelves for a time, both from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7445:33"/>divers exerciſes of religion, and from the aſſemblie of the people: as
<note n="d" place="margin">Le. 11, &amp; 15 Num. 5: 1-4. &amp; 19: 11-16. Deu. 23: 9-11.</note> if themſelves had the leproſie or any iſſu; if the man had his ſeed parting from him; or if the woman were in hir flowers: if at any time they did eat of that which died, or was torn with wild beaſts; or of any ſuch creature as was forbidden, whether beaſt, bird, or fiſh: or if they did but only touch them, or a dead bodie, or any ſuch thing as was by law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. To the ſelfe ſame end it is, that if
<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 15: 21, 22.</note> the beaſt that they ment to offer had any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, though it might be eaten at hom, yet might it not be brought unto the Lord,

                     </gap>, Lev. 19: 27.</note> moorn (as the heathen did) immoderately, but ſo take up themſelves betimes, that after they had yeelded a little to nature, they might forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with declare themſelves, very wel to like of Gods doings: that if
<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 21: 10-13.</note> an Iſraelite would marrie with an heathen woman taken in war, ſhe muſt firſt paſſe through certain ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies that ſhould witnes ſuch unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in hir, as that otherwiſe an Iſraelite might not marrie with hir: that
<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 23: 12-14.</note> when any man was diſpoſed to eaſe himſelfe, he ſhuld make a little pit, and after that he had done his eaſement therin, he would cover it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that no bodie might take noiance
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7445:33"/>therby: and
<note n="k" place="margin">Lev. 6: 28. &amp; 11: 33. &amp; 15: 12.</note> that even their pots and ſuch other veſſels as they had in uſe, ſhould in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers caſes be unclean unto them; and then, either broken, if they were of ſtone, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed if they were of wood, or ſcowred if they were of mettal. So likewiſe in the law of vowes many things there are that do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that although it be by nature a voluntarie act, and therfore may ſeem that needs it muſt be very welcom to God, yet is it not ſo eaſily excuſed, but altogither put by, unleſſe it bring ſinceritie with it beſides. For this cauſe firſt of al it is required, that
<note n="l" place="margin">Deu. 23: 18.</note> neither the filthie lucre that is gotten by fornication or ſuch like, nor ſo mean a thing as the price of a dog, be at time vowed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. So likewiſe,
<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 23: 21-23.</note> that when they had vowed ſuch things as might be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they ſhould not then delay the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of them: although that otherwiſe it had been no fault in them at al, not to have vowed. As alſo on the other ſide it was forbidden
<note n="n" place="margin">Lev. 27: 10.</note> to put a woorſe in the place of that which was vowed (which if they did, they had to give both: or
<note n="o" place="margin">Lev. 22: 18, 19.</note> to bring a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed beaſt for a vow before made: or
<note n="p" place="margin">Lev. 27: 28, 29.</note> to redeem or praeſerve any heerin, or that which was utterly abandoned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any uſe unto the Lord, as afterward
<note n="q" place="margin">Ioſ. 6: 17, 18 <hi>More ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of ſom.</hi>
                  </note> Iericho was after this maner by Ioſuah abandoned. Thoſe that do appertain more ſpecially to ſom, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7445:34"/>of their ſpecial profeſſion, are eſpecially but of two ſorts: ſuch as appertained to the preeſts; and ſuch as appertained to the Nazarites. The preeſts were ſuch as God had choſen from among the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple neerer unto him, and to have much dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him on the peoples behalfe. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them therfore he praeſcribeth certain rules of ſpecial ſanctification ſomwhat more ſtreightly than unto others. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, firſt generally to al, that they ſhould
<note n="r" place="margin">Le. 10: 8-11</note> not drink wine or any ſtrong drink, when it was their courſe to be about the office of their adminiſtration: to the end, that they might the better be able to judge betwixt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and unholie; between the clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; and better teach the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael as they ought. And that
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Lev. 21: 16-24.</note> none of them, of the ſeed of Aaron, having a blemiſh in any part of their bodie, might execute the preeſts office; and yet might live with them, and take their part of the holie offerings as much as others. Two other laws there were appointed to the preeſts, but not unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of them alike: the one of marrieng, the other of moorning, and other duties to frinds departed. Concerning marrieng, the law that was given, was to reſtrain the abuſe of unſeemly marrieng of themſelves. The
<note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 21: 13-15.</note> high preeſt mght not marrie any that had plaid the harlot, or been divorced, or was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7445:34"/>a widow: but only, a maid. The
<note n="u" place="margin">Lev. 21: 7, 8.</note> inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or preeſts might marrie widows: but not ſuch as had been polluted or defamed; or before divorced from any other. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning moorning, and ſuch other funeral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the high preeſt might
<note n="x" place="margin">Lev. 21: 10-12.</note> not moorn for any, or do ſuch things at funerals as others commonly were woont, and might. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior preeſts had ſom more libertie, but
<note n="y" place="margin">Lev. 21: 1-6.</note> yet reſtrained to certain perſons that were neer unto them; as father, mother, ſon, daughter, brother, and unmarried ſiſter: otherwiſe they might not have ought to do with the funerals of any; no not of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. As alſo, not only Aaron the high preeſt,
<note n="z" place="margin">Lev. 10: 6, 7.</note> but Eleazar, and Ithamar likewiſe being under preeſts, though heer they have libertie to moorn for their brethren, yet there they were forbid to moorn for thoſe two of their brethren, that were then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly deſtroied with fire for their ſin: belike, bicauſe they were taken away in Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and they could not wel moorn for them, but that they muſt ſeem ſomwhat to repine againſt the ſeveritie of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Nazarites were ſuch as tooke upon them a ſpecial vow of holines, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, but (as it were) of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Seeing therof that needs they would be Nazarites, that is, ſeparate from the common ſort, and drawing neerer (for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7445:35"/>time) unto the Lord, he gave unto them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo certain outward obſervations of ſpecial holines: that ſo in that voluntarie ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs, they might not ſo eaſily take in vain the name of God; but do indeed as they did praetend, and tooke upon them to obſerve. And the law that was given to the
<note n="a" place="margin">Nu. 6: 1-21.</note> Nazarite, was no more but to teach how, or in what maner to
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 1-5.</note> conſecrate himſelfe; how in the time of his ſeparation he might
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 6-9.</note> be defiled; how that pollution was to be
<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 9-12.</note> clenſed again; and how he had to
<note n="e" place="margin">Verſ. 13-21.</note> finiſh his vow of ſeparation. But the ſoldier alſo hath a ſpecial charge,
<note n="f" place="margin">De. 23: 9-11.</note> if he know himſelfe to be unclean, to avoid himſelfe out of the camp for the time.</p>
               <p n="24">24 The other point of this their dutie,
<note place="margin">And that they must be zealous withal.</note> that was to be directed to the perſon of God, is, that they ſhould be zealous towards God, or earneſtly bent to the way of godlines and religion: ſo to cal them from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon corruption of the world, in being ſo careleſſe of religion, or ſo faint in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, or any good work; and yet marvelous earneſtly bent on the vain, and corruptible things of this praeſent world. The things that do appertain heerunto are three. Firſt, the requiring of the ſeventh dais reſt: then the commending of the ſcriptures unto them: laſt of al the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vowes. Concerning the ſeventh dais
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7445:35"/>reſt, it was ordeined,
<note place="margin">First in the ſabbaoth.</note> that
<note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 20: 8-11. &amp; 23: 12.31: 13-17. &amp; 34: 21.35: 1-3. Lev. 19: 3, 30.26: 2. Deu. 5: 12-15.</note> everie ſeventh day ſhould be a ſabbaoth, that is, a day of reſt: the meaning wherof was, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves withal their families &amp; their cattel alſo; and that al ſuch ſtrangers as dwelt among them with their families and cattel, ſhould that day ceaſe from al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their uſual labors, and keep it an holie reſt unto the Lord. To the end they might the better obſerve it, he doth both give them to underſtand, that as he doth therby
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 19: 2, 3.</note> require holines of them, ſo doth he himſelfe
<note n="c" place="margin">Exo. 20: 11. &amp; 31: 13.</note> ſanctifie thoſe that truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and ſo performeth in them his own requeſt: and, although he do ſo praeciſely require it, that he alloweth not ſo much as the
<note n="d" place="margin">Exo. 35: 3.</note> kindeling of a fire on that day, no not
<note n="e" place="margin">Exo. 34: 21.</note> in ſeed time, nor in harveſt; yet maketh he the
<note n="f" place="margin">Exo. 31: 14, 15. &amp; 35: 2.</note> breach therof to be death. As alſo he ſheweth them another commoditie that hangeth theron, which himſelfe to their own uſe requireth, that is, that he wil have that a reſt-day
<note n="g" place="margin">Exo. 20: 10. 23: 12.</note> that themſelves, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and cattel may reſt theron from their woonted labors: which muſt needs make them a great deal more freſh to continu their labor.
<note place="margin">Then in the ſtudie of the ſcriptures.</note> The ſcriptures were commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them that they ſhould have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard of them, and be very ſtudious both to know, &amp; to do the law of the Lord. To this they were lead three maner of wais.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7445:36"/>The firſt was, that they ſhould have the words of the law written, and that verie plainly,
<note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 27: 2, 3, 4, 8.</note> firſt upon certain great ſtones, ſet up, and plaſtered for the ſame purpoſe at the entrance of the land, ſo ſoone as they ſhal com thither: then
<note n="l" place="margin">Deu. 6: 5-9.</note> in their own houſes upon the gates and poſts therof: yea, and to have the ſame
<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 11: 18-21.</note> bound to their hands, and as a frontlet between their eies to put them in better remembrance therof. The next was, that they were commanded to have
<note n="n" place="margin">Num. 15: 37-41. Deu. 22: 12.</note> fringes, and ribbands of blew ſilk upon their garments, to put them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the law of the Lord, to do after it, and not to follow their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, little regarding the law of the Lord. The laſt was, that they were willed both for their own better inſtruction, and for the ſpreading forth of religion continually to
<note n="o" place="margin">Deut. 6: 7. &amp; 11: 19.</note> teach the law to their children, and to talk therof in their own houſes, or as they walked by the way, when they laid them down to ſleep, and when they roſe up again to their work. By al which things we may perceive that he would have them verie ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and careful how to be godly. In which reſpect he doth alſo warn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Deut. 6: 10-12. &amp; 8: 10-15.</note> then ſpecially to take heed to themſelves that they do not forget the Lord, when they ſhal wax weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, and have abundance of al good things: for bicauſe that worldly felicitie, ingendring
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7445:36"/>in man a love of the ſame, doth very much abate the zeal that erſt before we had unto godlines, and maketh us worldly, inſomuch that after that once we com unto wealth, then do we for the moſt part
<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 6: 24. Luc. 16: 13 1. Tim. 6: 9, 10</note> either utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpiſe the way of godlines, and wholy give over our ſelves to the world: or els do we lean ſo much to the latter, that we do verie much diſpiſe the former.
<note place="margin">Lastly in vowes, or voluntarie worſhip.</note> The allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of vowes that before I ſpake of is this. Seeing that it pleaſed God to allow of vows, as it may ſufficiently appeer by that which is ſaid of them alreadie; and wheras a vow is nothing els in effect, but a voluntarie work of thanks-giving to God for his goodnes towards us, by proceeding out of a more fervent zeal, than is for the moſt part to be found, either in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon multitude, or otherwiſe in himſelfe that voweth: heerby it appeereth, that GOD doth not only allow of a ſingular zeal; but ſeeing that himſelfe doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to praepare the way wherin it may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceed, and wherby it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to com unto him, and to his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acceptance, he doth himſelfe alſo invite us therunto, or rather ſeeketh to breed in us a ſpecial and a ſingular care to do our ſervice unto the Lord: the thing that now we have in hand.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Concerning their life one towards
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7445:37"/>another,
<note place="margin">Of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.</note> that which firſt we have to fal in hand withal, which is, that everie one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor their parents, and ſo conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ech other in his degree, ſo far as he is any father or mother unto him, is in the law very breefly ſet down: belike bicauſe it is ſo imprinted in the harts of al generally, that the contrarie vice is odious withal; and ſharply reſtreined of the higher ſort. But although the law in this point be verie breefe, yet is it effectual. For firſt of al, as touching
<note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 20: 12. Deut. 5: 16. Lev, 19: 3.</note> their natural parents they were required to give them du honor; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<note n="b" place="margin">Deu. 22: 30</note> to marrie their fathers wife. As touching
<note n="c" place="margin">Exo. 22: 28.</note> ſuperiors, not to rail or ſpeak evil of them: as touching the
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 19: 32.</note> aged, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence them. And to the end that they may better perceive how much they ought to aeſteem of al men, eſpecially of thoſe that were to good uſe unto them, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both in ſuch ſort to do
<note n="e" place="margin">Deu. 23: 12-14.</note> their eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it be no noiance to any, and ſo to aeſteem of their
<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 25: 4.</note> laboring ox, as that while he treadeth out their corn, they mooſel him not. As indeed if we conſider that al ſuch creatures are made to our uſe, and that by them we reap a notable commoditie one way or other, as Salomon
<note n="g" place="margin">Pro. 12: 10.</note> ſaith, that a juſt man regardeth the life of his beaſt, when as even the mercies of the wicked are cruel: ſo whoſoever entereth into this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7445:37"/>if therwithal he be of a thankful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he more aeſteemeth of the meaneſt creatures of al that are to any uſe unto us, than the common ſort of worldly people do ſoundly aeſteem of their own natural pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p n="26">26 The next is,
<note place="margin">What care they ſhould have of their neighbors life or good estate ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</note> that they were bound to have a care to praeſerve and uphold their neighbor in his good eſtate: and firſt as touching his life, and whatſoever doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain therunto.

Al which may be digeſted into two ſorts. Wherof the former is of thoſe that directly and in plain ſpeech do treat therof: the other of thoſe that by outward ceremonies do mean the ſelfeſame thing. Thoſe that do it directly or in plain terms do firſt of al forbid al maner of violence and hard dealing towards al. As namely, to ſeek the blood of any; or to

Their ſacraments (that were of this kind) were only two: Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the Paſcal lamb. Both which, although they were ordained ſomwhat
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 17: 1-14. Exo. 12: 1-20.</note> before the law was given in mount Sinai; yet were they
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 12: 3. Ioſ. 7: 22. Lev. 23: 5. Num. 9: 2. <hi>Circumciſion</hi>
                  </note> confirmed by the ſame, and under it in common uſe, and great force. Circumciſion was ordained to Abraham at the firſt,
<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 17: 7, 10, 24.</note> what time he ſojourned in the land of Canaan, himſelfe being 99. yeers old: which was 406. yeers before the giving of the law in Sinai. The matter of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the
<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 17: 11, 12.</note> cutting away of the foreskin of the privie members of al the male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the land: and
<note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 12: 3.</note> when the child was eight dais old, then was this ſacrament to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7445:40"/>be miniſtred unto him. The
<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 17: 7.</note> meaning of the ſacrament was, that God made with Abraham and with his ſeed, an everlaſting covenant of ſpecial favor: that him and his ſeed God tooke to himſelfe, to be his own peculiar people: and for that cauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have a ſpecial conſideration, that the ſeal of the covenant was printed on that part of the bodie: that therin they might more plainly behold, both that there was a
<note n="g" place="margin">Deu. 30: 6.</note> mortification of the fleſh wrought by the ſpirit of God, in al that were under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in ſpirit and truth; and that their
<note n="h" place="margin">Ge. 17: 7, 8. Deut. 30: 6.</note> children appertained to the covenant, as wel as themſelves. And it is to be noted, that they were taken to be his people before; and this pledge, or the ſeal of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant afterward given. As for the day, the reaſon ſeemeth to be this, that both chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be of ſom ſtrength to bear it; &amp; that they ſhould not long delay to miniſter that comfortable ſacrament unto them. Laſt of al
<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 17: 12-14.</note> it was ordeined, that al ſhould take that ſacrament on them: and that ſuch as would not, ſhould be cut off from among the people. The Paſcal lamb,
<note place="margin">The paſcal lamb.</note> their other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, was inſtituted or ordeined to the whole people
<note n="k" place="margin">Ex. 12: 3, 51.</note> a little before their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Aegypt. The matter of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was this. The
<note n="l" place="margin">Ex. 12: 1-11.</note> tenth day of their firſt moneth (named Niſan) they ſhould take
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7445:41"/>from among their ſheep or goates, a yoong ſheep or a goat of a yeer old, of the male kind, and the ſame without blemiſh: him ſhould they keep until the fourteenth day of the moneth, and then kil him at even.
<note n="m" place="margin">Ver. 7: 22.</note> Then they ſhould take the blood of him in a baſen, &amp; with a bunch of hyſop ſprinkle of the ſame on the upper poſts of their doores, and on both the ſide poſts. They ſhould
<note n="n" place="margin">Ver. 8, 9, 46.</note> roſt the carcaſe whole, and not break a bone of it: they ſhould
<note n="o" place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> eat it with unleavened bread; with ſower herbs; and like

This ſacrament was ordeined to be received
<note n="r" place="margin">Exo. 12: 14.</note> everie yeer once, at the time by the law appointed; &amp; had
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Verſ. 14-20.</note> one of the three principal feaſts therunto annexed. By the reaſon
<note n="t" place="margin">Num. 9: 6-9.</note> of uncleanes, or being in journey, it might be deferred to the ſame day of the next moneth. But
<note n="u" place="margin">Num. 9: 13.</note> otherwiſe might not be deferred of thoſe that were clean, and were at hom. Howbeit, the unclean might not eat therof. The meaning of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7445:41"/>was, both to aſſure the people that then lived, of two notable benefits that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the inſtitution of it were to inſu: and to
<note n="x" place="margin">Exo. 12: 14, 24-27, 42.</note> keep up thoſe benefits in freſh remembrance, both to themſelves and to al their children, that ſhould afterward follow. The benefits, of which they were heerby aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured at the firſt inſtitution heerof, and which afterward were kept in memorie by the ſame, were,
<note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 12: 13, 23, 29.</note> that the Lord ſpared them at the ſprinkling of the blood of that lamb, when as he deſtroied the firſt born of al the land beſides; and

Nevertheles, bicauſe theſe benefits could not be grounded but in their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſavior, therfore did this ſacrament to ſo many as had that conſideration nouriſh (beſides) a comfortable, and a faithful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Chriſt, and of the force of his death and paſſion: as afterward he was more plainly known, to be both our

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7445:42"/>certain other things firſt had; and of their ſolemn feaſts withal. Thoſe other things are eſpecially three: what was the place were they might ſacrifice unto the Lord; what the perſons were that ought to do it; and what were thoſe creatures out of which they had to chooſe their ſacrifice. So it ſhal be needful, to ſay ſomwhat of theſe things firſt: and after to come to the ſacrifices themſelves. And concerning the place it is firſt to be conſidered that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint was made: then, what the place was wherunto they were reſtrained. The reſtraint that was made, was that they ſhould offer their ſacrifice no where els, but only before the Lord. And that was, for the time of their pilgrimage, and until another place was choſen, only where the ſanctuarie was: afterward in Ieruſalem, at the temple there. Concerning the former of theſe,
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 17: 3-5, 8, 9.</note> it was death to offer any where els when they were in the wildernes, either in the hoſt, or without, but only before the ſanctuarie or tabernacle. As touching the other, they were warned beforehand
<note n="b" place="margin">De. 12: 4-14</note> that when they came to their land they ſhuld not offer their ſacrifices where they thought good, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that place, which the Lord ſhuld chooſe or name unto them. Nevertheles, bicauſe we are now to inquire, but only of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of government that in the wildernes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7445:42"/>was praeſcribed unto them; and bicauſe the maner and uſe of the former doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the uſe and maner of the latter: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhal be ſufficient for us, for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe that now we have taken, to caſt our eies on the ſanctuarie only, as it was at the firſt ordeined unto them. But bicauſe that it was mooveable, therfore it is expedient to conſider, both what the thing it ſelfe was, and what was the maner of remooving the ſame.
<note place="margin">Of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</note> The place it ſelfe conſiſted of two principal parts: the tabernacle, and court wherin it ſtood. The tabernacle it ſelfe was as it were a church or chappel, ordained for divine ſervice; but of ſet purpoſe ſo made, as that it might be taken down, carried with them, and ſet up again, ſo oft as they would: as it was expedient and needful for them, who at that time that it was ordained, were in a long and cumberſom journie towards the land of Canaan. It was therfore
<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 26: 15-30.</note> made of divers parcels, redily framed to be joined togither, ſo to ſtand by it ſelfe upright. In ſteed of a roofe
<note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 26: 1-14. Exo. 25: 37.</note> it had coverings caſt over the top of it: and lights within, in ſteed of windows. Which frame being ſo ſet togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was of that quantitie, that (if their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit were al one with ours) then

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7445:43"/>general view therof. But to the end that we may more perfectly ſee it, let us now more ſpecially conſider, wherof it was made; how it was parted; and wherwithal ech part was furniſhed. Concerning the ſtuffe, the text declareth that the ſides therof were made of
<note n="f" place="margin">Exo. 26: 15.</note> boords: which notwithſtanding were ſuch, as we more properly cal planks. As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the uſe wherunto they were ordained doth neceſſarily import that they muſt needs be of good thiknes. And
<note n="g" place="margin">Ant. Iud. li. 3. cap. 5.</note> Ioſephus writeth that they were a handful thik. They were of a kind of wood which they called Setim, ſomwhat like to white thorn, and ſo durable that it is ſaid of ſom, never to rot. They were
<note n="h" place="margin">Exo. 26: 16, 18, 20, 22-25.</note> in length, five yards; in breadth, one cubit and an halfe; in number, for ech ſide twentie, and for the weſt end eight: which truly anſwer the aforeſaid meaſure of the tabernacle.
<note n="i" place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> Everie of theſe boords had at the neather end a couple of tenons: for the which there were provided as many
<note n="k" place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> ſockets with mortaſes in them, wherinto the boords were to be let, when the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was to be reared. And
<note n="l" place="margin">Verſ. 26-30.</note> to compact the whole frame better togither, there were ordained certain bars of the ſame kind of wood for every ſide five: of which one ſhuld paſſe through the midſt of the boords throughout the whole ſide of the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the other four ſhould by certain
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7445:43"/>rings be coupled to the boords, and ſo join them faſt togither.
<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 26: 29.</note> Al theſe boords, with their bars and rings were overlaid with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gold: and
<note n="n" place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> their ſockets were of ſilver. The coverings or hangings that were caſt aloft on the tabernacle, were divers: thoſe that were in-moſt, very fair, and coſtly; thoſe that were out-moſt, of courſer work, and ſuch as were meeteſt to bear off the weather. The
<note n="o" place="margin">Exo. 26: 1-6</note> in-moſt of al was fine twined linen, blew ſilk, and purple, and ſcarlet, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered fair.
<note n="p" place="margin">Ver. 7-13.</note> The next unto it of goats hair:
<note n="q" place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> the third of rams skins colored red: the fourth, and out-moſt of al of bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers skins; with the hair on (as it ſeemeth) for that ſo it might better keep off the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which hangings
<note n="r" place="margin">Verſ. 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, 13.</note> were of that large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that they did cover the whole frame round about halfe way to the ground, but only at that end which was left open for the way to com in. At which
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Verſ. 36, 37.</note> there was hung a rich hanging of needle work, made of fine twined linen, of blew ſilk, of purple, &amp; ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. Which was hung on five pillers, for that purpoſe provided, whoſe heads or tops were of gold, their ſockets of braſſe, and the reſt of Setim wood, overlaid with beaten gold. So have we the outward face or ſhew of the tabernacle. Within, it was divided into two parts: the diviſion being made
<note n="t" place="margin">Verſ. 31, 32, 33.</note> by a rich hanging of the ſame work that the in-moſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7445:44"/>covering of the tabernacle was of, which was hung on four pillers like to the others, ſaving that their ſockets were of ſilver. Wheras therfore before it was one, now, by this partition, it is becom two: wherof
<note n="u" place="margin">Verſ. 33.</note> the out-moſt &amp; eaſt part, was termed the holie place, or the tabernacle of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the in-moſt or weſt part, the moſt holie place. In the out-moſt of theſe two
<note n="x" place="margin">Ver. 35, &amp; 30: 6.</note> there were three principal things: a table, a frame for lights, and an aultar; in the in-moſt,
<note n="y" place="margin">Verſ. 33, 34.</note> but one, which was the ark of teſtimonie. The table was
<note n="z" place="margin">Exo. 25: 23-25.</note> of Setim wood, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with beaten gold, and the work therof was fair. The frame that was ordained for lights, was
<note n="a" place="margin">Verſ. 31-37.</note> as it were a great ſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtik of beaten gold, branching foorth in ſuch ſort on ech ſide, that it yeelded in al ſeven branches, on the tops of which were ſeven lamps. The
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 30: 1, 3.</note> altar that I ſpeak of, was of timberwork within, as the table was: but overlaid with beaten gold. The uſe
<note n="c" place="margin">Exo. 25: 30.</note> of the table was that theron ſhould be bread continually, which was called the ſhew-bread
<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 37.</note> of the ſtanding candleſtik, to give light: and
<note n="e" place="margin">Ex. 30: 7-10.</note> of the aultar that incenſe or ſweet perfume ſhal everie day be burned, and once a yeer the reconciliation made theron. Of which afterward ſomwhat more largely. Theſe were

<note n="h" place="margin">Exo. 25: 17-19.</note> at ech end a cherub, with their faces, &amp; wings ſtretched foorth one towards another: and the place where their wings met (about the midſt of the cheſt lid) was a place of ſpecial account. This cheſt was called
<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 25: 16, 21.</note> the ark of teſtimonie, for that it had the tables of teſtimonie, or ten commandements therin: and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place of the lid between the wings of the cherubins, was called the

<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 25: 12-15, 26-28, &amp; 30: 4, 5.</note> that both this ark, and altar, and table in the other; had rings and bars of the ſame ſtuffe that themſelves were of, for the more convenient carriage of them. We read alſo of certain other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, that did appertain to certain of theſe: as of
<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 25: 29.</note> certain diſhes, goblets, or bouls, and incenſe cups; that did appertain unto the table, that ſo the ſhew-bread might more decently be ſet theron, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe on the top of the ſame: &amp;

<note place="margin">Of the court of the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</note> not only the court it ſelfe: but divers other things likewiſe that were placed therin. The court that I ſpeak of, was a plot of ground taken into the uſe of the tabernacle: wherin the tabernacle it ſelfe was placed, and divers other things done, that did appertain to the worſhip and ſervice of God. The
<note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 27: 9-18.</note> form of it was ſquare: the quantitie of it fiftie yards in length, and five and twentie in bredth:
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with hangings of fine twined linen
<note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 18, &amp; 38: 18.</note> two yards and an halfe high, hoong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pillers for the ſame purpoſe provided. Which

<note n="e" place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> having their ſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of braſſe; and their heads or tops of ſilver. But
<note n="f" place="margin">Verſ. 14, 15.</note> at the eaſt end (where was the comming in) the linen hangings did reach from ech corner towards the midſt of that end, but fifteen cubits only, and ſo fifteen yards in al: and left the other ten yards in the mids,
<note n="g" place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> to be hoong with a richer hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was of blew ſilk, and purple, and ſcarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needle. To the hangings alſo, and curtains of the ſanctuarie did
<note n="h" place="margin">Exo. 27: 19. &amp; 38: 20. Num. 3: 37. &amp; 4: 20.</note> appertain a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number of cords, &amp; braſen pins to rear up theſe things, and to faſten them unto the ground. In which court, the tabernacle or ſanctuarie was reared towards the upper end therof, that ſo the other part of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7445:45"/>court might yeeld more convenient roome for ſuch ſervice as was there to be done. The other things that were placed therin and belong to this diſcourſe, were eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two: the braſen altar, and the great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The
<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 27: 1, 2.</note> braſen altar, which was for burnt ſacrifices, and ſuch like, was of timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work within, but overlaid with braſſe round about: and
<note n="k" place="margin">Verſ. 4, 5.</note> had within, in the hollow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a grate of braſſe, wheron the ſacrifice ſhould lie with the fire, and wood therunto belonging. And this altar
<note n="l" place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> was in length five cubits, in bredth as much, and in height three: and had
<note n="m" place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> horns at the corners ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, of the ſame ſtuffe, that it ſelfe was of, wherby they might more conveniently bind their ſacrifices unto the altar. Vnto which altar
<note n="n" place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> belonged certain other imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as namely, aſh-pans, beeſoms, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, fleſh-hooks, fire-pans, and ſuch like: al which were of braſſe, ſutable unto the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar it ſelfe. This altar was to be placed in the neather part of the court, as it were about the midſt of the whole, before the doore of the tabernacle, and a reaſonable diſtance from it. The
<note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 30: 17-21.</note> laver was a mightie great veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of braſſe, wherat the preeſts ſhould waſh, when they went into the ſanctuarie, and when they came foorth again to offer any ſacrifice: and therfore was it placed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient room meet for that purpoſe; even

<note place="margin">How they had to pitch about the tabernacle: and in what ſort they had to remoove.</note> was to be caried from place to place: and to be placed among the people, not at aventure, but after a ſet praeſcribed order. Heer therfore we have more ſpecially to conſider, both how they camped about the tabernacle, and how they removed. Of thoſe that camped about the tabernacle, there were two ſorts: ſom that had ſom ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial charge about it; &amp; the reſidu of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thoſe that had ſom ſpecial charge were eſpecially, Moſes, &amp; Aaron: then alſo al the Levites beſides. Moſes &amp; Aaron camped
<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 3: 38.</note> at the eaſt end of the tabernacle, before the entrance therunto; the Levites about, by the other ſides: the Koathites on the
<note n="b" place="margin">Num. 3: 29.</note> ſouth ſide, whoſe number then
<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 4: 36.</note> was 2750; the Gerſonites on the

<note n="e" place="margin">Num. 4: 40.</note> was 2630; and the Merarites on the
<note n="f" place="margin">Num. 3: 35.</note> north ſide, whoſe number
<note n="g" place="margin">Num. 4: 44.</note> was 3200. The reſidu of the people camped a convenient ſpace without theſe: but round about the tabernacle alſo. At the
<note n="h" place="margin">Num. 2: 3-9</note> eaſt end camped the tribe of Iudah with two other tribes, Iſachar, and Zabulon aſſociate unto him; but it ſelfe bearing the ſtandard: who were in al 186400. On the
<note n="i" place="margin">Nu. 2: 10-16</note> ſouth ſide Ruben bearing the ſtandard, with Simeon, &amp; Gad
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7445:46"/>aſſociate unto him: who were in al, 151450. at the
<note n="k" place="margin">Nu. 2: 18-24</note> weſt end, Ephraim bearing the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, Manaſſes and Benjamin being under the ſame: whoſe number was 108100. On the
<note n="l" place="margin">Nu. 2: 25-31</note> north ſide the tribe of Dan, with Aſſer, &amp; Nephthalie his accomplices: whoſe hoſt was 157600. When they were to remoove, the
<note n="m" place="margin">Num. 9: 17-23.</note> cloud aſcending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tabernacle, &amp; going forward, did both give them warning of remooving, and it ſelfe led them the way. Then the preeſts were to com &amp; lap up the ark, &amp; the other holie things: &amp; themſelves, with the ark on their ſholders, firſt of al to follow after. At which time
<note n="n" place="margin">Num. 10: 35</note> Moſes was woont to ſay; Ariſe, O Lord, &amp; let thine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſcattered, &amp; let them that hate thee flie before thee. Concerning the people,
<note n="o" place="margin">Nu. 10: 5, 6.</note> at the ſound of the trumpet they were to ſet forward in thoſe four main armies, everie one under their ſtandard:
<note n="p" place="margin">Num. 2: 2, 17.10: 5, 6.</note> firſt Iudah; then Ruben; thirdly Ephraim; &amp; laſt of al Dan, which alſo was called
<note n="q" place="margin">Num. 10: 25</note> the gathering hoſt, bicauſe it ſhut up al, and tooke al with it, that dragged or fainted by the way. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Levites it is not ſo plainly ſet down how they ſhould march on: but by the nature of their charge, and by a journie that afterward they tooke, it appeereth, that the
<note n="r" place="margin">Num. 10: 17</note> Gerſonites and Merarites went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt two armies, the one carrieng the timber-work of the tabernacle, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7445:47"/>the curtains &amp; hangings: and ſo made al readie againſt the others came. Then that
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Num. 2: 17. 10: 21.</note> the Koathites followed in the midſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſecond and the third armie, with the ſanctuarie, and the holie things. The third ſpace between the battels, that is, the ſpace betwixt the third and the fourth main armies ſeemeth to be left for thoſe that were ſik, feeble, and wearie, bicauſe that ſo the hoſt of Dan (that
<note n="t" place="margin">Num. 10: 25.</note> came laſt and ſhut up al) might beſt ſee unto them. And thus going on in roial maner, they were
<note n="u" place="margin">Num. 9: 18.</note> not to reſt, til the cloud, that comfortable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Gods praeſence, did ſtay. But where it ſtaied, there did the preeſt ſet down the ark: and then was Moſes woont to
<note n="x" place="margin">Num. 10: 36</note> ſay; Return, O Lord, to the many thouſands of Iſrael; ſo (as it were) welcoming hom the Lord again. The Levites alſo and preeſts,
<note n="y" place="margin">Num. 10: 21</note> ſet al ſuch things as belonged to them in their place again: and the
<note n="z" place="margin">Num. 2: 34.</note> reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pitched round about in their order as before is deſcribed. So it appeereth that the Lord would both dwel in the midſt of his people; and whenſoever they had to travel, then wold himſelfe lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this maner of remooving &amp; camping was but for a time, only ſo long as they were in the wildernes, therfore for this matter this ſhort diſcourſe may wel inough ſuffice.</p>
               <p n="35">35 The perſons to whom the ſacrificing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7445:47"/>of theſe things belonged, were two:
<note place="margin">Of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the tribe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie about the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</note> the people that did bring their ſacrifice; &amp; the preeſts &amp; Levites which were the ordinarie miniſters of thoſe affairs. The partie that broght the ſacrifice, had no more to do but
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 1: 3.</note> to bring it willingly of his own accord, &amp; to preſent it before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: but it did appertain to them al, to ſee they were
<note n="b" place="margin">Nu. 9: 6-10.</note> clean, for that ſuch as were unclean, might not praeſume to any ſuch matter: inſomuch that
<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 8: 6, 23, 24, 30.</note> the preeſts themſelves were to be clenſed before they entered into that office; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were ſpecially choſen therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
<note place="margin">Of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</note> The other parties that had to deal in the offering of ſacrifices, and whom that action did properly concern, were (as I ſaid) the preeſts and Levites. Theſe were one whole tribe or familie of that people, &amp; were
<note n="d" place="margin">Num. 3: 11-13, 45. &amp; 8: 14</note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from the reſt to the miniſterie of the tabernacle. Out of which tribe,
<note n="e" place="margin">Exo. 28: 1. &amp; 29: 44.</note> ſom were exempted from the reſt, and appointed to be preeſts: the
<note n="f" place="margin">Num. 3: 5-9</note> reſt were left to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſervice of the tabernacle, at the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preeſts, and by the proper name of their kindred were called Levites.
<note place="margin">Of the preests.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preeſthood it is firſt to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the ſucceſſion and dignitie therof
<note n="g" place="margin">Exo. 28: 1. &amp; 29: 9, 29: 30. Num. 25: 13.</note> was appointed to one only familie of the Levites ever to remain therin, and to go by diſcent, from the father to the ſon. So that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7445:48"/>they were not ordained to be choſen out of the woorthieſt: but from time to time were ſuch, as that ſame one line did yeeld. And yet was it their office to be mediators betwixt God, and man, ſo far as the nature of figures may bear: and, in the mean while, to repraeſent in themſelves, and in the office to them committed, the notable mediation that afterward by another was to be made. Wherby it may ſufficiently appeer that the force or merit of reconciliation, or of the attonement betwixt God and man, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not on the woorthines or merit of man, but only on the favorable acceptance or goodnes of God. But as the whole tribe of Levie was taken
<note n="h" place="margin">Num. 3: 11, 12, 13. &amp; 18: 6</note> neerer to the ſanctuarie of the Lord, than the reſt of the people; and the preeſts advanced
<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 28: 1. &amp; Nu. 18: 7.</note> to an higher degree than they: ſo among the preeſts alſo there was ſuch a diſtinction, that
<note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 28: 3. Lev. 21: 10. Num. 35: 25.</note> one was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the high preeſt; and the reſt inferior preeſts under him. Concerning al which, we have to ſee theſe two things; how they were praepared unto their function; and what was the proper function of everie one.
<note place="margin">The apparel of the high preest.</note> Their praeparation conſiſted in two things; in their appareling, and conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The apparel that was appointed for the high preeſt, was verie
<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 28: 2.</note> honorable and fair, and for the moſt part ſuch, as the great men in thoſe countries did commonly wear,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7445:48"/>excepting the proper form that it had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly in it ſelfe. His in-moſt garment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ordinarie and
<note n="m" place="margin">Lev. 16: 23, 24.</note> uſual clothing,
<note n="n" place="margin">Ex. 28: 4, 39.</note> was of fine linen, and the ſame imbrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The
<note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 28: 4, 31-35.</note> next unto was ſomwhat ſhorter, but of blew ſilk, and having bels of gold, and pomgranates of ſilk hanging round about on the skirts therof. The
<note n="p" place="margin">Ex. 28: 4, 6-8</note> uppermoſt garment of al was called an Ephod, which in ſhape and form was a ſhort coat, cloſe before: but in ſubſtance, and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it was verie coſtly and rich. For it was made of gold, blew ſilk; purple, ſcarlet, and fine linen, and the ſame imbrodered. Al which were
<note n="q" place="margin">Ex. 28: 4, 39</note> girded togither with a girdle of needle work. Moreover he had hanging down before his breſt,
<note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 28: 15-21.</note> a kind of tablet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a breſt-plate of brodered work like unto the Ephod it ſelfe, an hand breadth ſquare, ſet with twelve precious ſtones of divers kinds, everie one of them having the name of one of the tribes of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ingraven therin. Which
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Exod. 28: 14, 22-29.</note> breſt-plate or tablet was by certain chains and rings faſtened beneath to the Ephod it ſelfe, and above on the top of the ſholders, to a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of imboſments of gold that for that purpoſe were ſet on the Ephod, on ech ſholder one: wherin

The
<note n="x" place="margin">Exo. 28: 39, 36-38.</note> attire of his head was of fine linen: and on the forefront therof had a fair plate of beaten gold, by certain laces faſtened therunto, wherin was written; <hi>Holines unto the Lord.</hi> The

                  </note> apparel that was for the inferior preeſts, was alſo ordained to be ſuch, as might be both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fair: the particulars wherof were theſe, coats, girdels, bonets, and breeches. Which breeches were to this end ordained, that wheras it was the maner of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go in long clothing, the preeſts might ſomtimes have their nakednes diſcovered, their clothes flaring open, &amp; themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occupied about their buſines, but only by the help of theſe: and for that cauſe they were ordained not only for the inferior preeſt, but alſo for the
<note n="z" place="margin">Exo. 28: 43.</note> high preeſt likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Their conſecration was a ſolemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting of them into the office that they had to perform,
<note place="margin">The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the preests.</note> and had two principal parts:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7445:49"/>the fact of Moſes on their behalfe; and then what was left unto them to do for their ſelves. The fact of Moſes was this. Firſt of al he muſt have in a readines
<note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 29: 1, 2, 3 Lev. 8: 2.</note> one bullok or calfe of a yeer old, and two rams without blemiſh: and one basket of unlevened bread, of cakes unlevened tempered with oil, and of wafers unlevened annointed with oil. Then
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 29: 4.</note> bringing Aaron and his ſons towards the doore of the tabernacle, there
<note n="c" place="margin">Exo 29: 4-9. Lev. 8: 6-9, 13</note> did he waſh them. Which being done, then did he put on their apparel; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the high preeſt with the holie, and praecious oil. Having ſo far done with their perſons,
<note n="d" place="margin">Exo. 29: 10. Lev. 8: 14.</note> he ſetteth in hand with the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that on their behalfe were to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; which were three. A ſin offering; a burnt offering; and the ſacrifice of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. The
<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 29: 10-14. Lev. 8: 14-17.</note> ſin offering was a yoong bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lok, or a calfe of a yeer old, without blemiſh, wheron Aaron and his ſons that were to be conſecrated muſt lay their hand. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, then had Moſes to kil the bullok, to put of the blood on the horns of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: to burn the fat, the kal, and the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neies upon the altar; and to ſend away al the reſt, the fleſh, the hide, and the doong to be burnt without the hoſt, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſin offerings. The
<note n="f" place="margin">Exod 29: 15-18. Lev. 8: 18-21.</note> burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was a ram, wheron Aaron and his ſons muſt in like ſort lay their hands, and then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7445:50"/>did Moſes ſlea the ſame: ſprinkling the blood round about the altar, cutting the ram into certain peeces, waſhing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and feet therof, and then laieng al togither on the altar, to be conſumed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with fire. The
<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 29: 19-21. Lev. 8: 22-24, 30.</note> other ram was for the ſacrifice of conſecration: on which Aaron and his ſons did firſt lay their hands, and then did Moſes kil it as before. With the blood of the ſacrifice firſt of al was to be touched the lap, or nether part of the right ear, both of Aaron, and of his ſons, the right thumb likewiſe, and the right toe of everie of them: then ſhould the altar be ſprinkled therwith round about: laſtly with it; and the annointing oil mingled togither, both Aaron and his ſons and al their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to be ſprinkled. The carcaſe of this ſacrifice was thus divided. Only
<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 29: 22-28. Lev: 8: 25-29.</note> the fat, the rump, the kal &amp; the kidneies, and the right ſholder were conſumed with fire on the altar: the reſt was given to Aaron and his ſons to be their portion, ſaving only the breſt, which was (for the time) the portion of Moſes. That part which was burnt had put therunto out of the basket before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned one lofe, one cake, and one wafer: and were al togither firſt given into the hands of Aaron and his ſons. The reſidu of the fleſh that
<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 29: 31-34. Lev. 8: 31, 32.</note> was given to Aaron and his ſons, had al the reſt of the bread to go ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7445:50"/>Of which none might eat but Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and his ſons, and that ſodden, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doore of the tabernacle: none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might eat therof; and ſo much as remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned til the next day, was to be burned. Al
<note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 29: 35-37. Lev. 8: 33-36.</note> theſe ſacrifices on the behalfe of Aaron and his ſons for their conſecration, were to be offered ſeven dais togither, after one and the ſelfeſame maner: ſo to clenſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the altar for the miniſtration, which by Aaron and his ſons was afterward to be done on the ſame. Concerning that which was left to Aaron and his ſons to do for themſelves, it was no more, but, after that once in maner aforeſaid they were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by Moſes, themſelves to enter into their office. So
<note n="l" place="margin">Lev. 9: 1, 2.</note> when the ſeven dais of their conſecration were finiſhed, the eight day themſelves did enter into their office. At which time (beſide

<note place="margin">Of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn feasts and times.</note> of them there were two ſorts: one of dais; another of yeers. Of dais there were
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7445:53"/>divers: firſt the ſabbath everie weeke; then the firſt day of everie moneth; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others that came everie yeer.
<note place="margin">Sabbaths.</note> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſabbath, the word by nature doth ſignifie reſt: and the ordinance of God for it was, that wheras he had moſt liberally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his people to beſtow ſix dais in the weeke about their uſual labors, the ſeventh day he would have them ever to reſt, and to keep it holie unto the Lord. Which being firſt

<note n="d" place="margin">1. Sam. 20: 5 2. King. 4: 23.</note> we find it often rekoned among their feſtival dais; and ſomtimes to be ſo ſpecially na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it ſeemeth with them to have bin of ſom ſpecial account. As that David

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7445:54"/>of the paſcal lamb,
<note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 12: 6.13: 10. Lev. 25: 5, 6. Nu. 9: 2, 3, 13.</note> although the law did generally require, both that everie one ſhould eat therof, and appointed both one time and place for al: yet did it allow of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

<note place="margin">Pentecost.</note> The feaſt of

Lev. 23; 15-17 Deu. 16: 9-12.</note> Pentecoſt which followed next in order, was the fiftith day after Eaſter: which alſo was to be holden a verie holie feaſt unto the Lord, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their deliverance out of the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Aegypt. For which their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they were willed, themſelves and their families to rejoice togither before the Lord: and to bring with them two loaves of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread to praeſent the Lord withal. And the better to advance the ſolemnitie of this feaſt (beſides the praeſence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe loaves that they had to bring for themſelves and ther families) there was
<note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 23: 18-21.</note> a ſpecial ſacrifice appointed on behalfe of the whole people for that pręſent day. After this feaſt of Pentecoſt which fel in the third moneth of the yeer, they had no more til they came to the ſeventh: ſaving only the firſt of everie moneth, that before was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. But when the ſeventh moneth came in, which was about the end of ſommer, it did bring with it two notable feaſts beſides the firſt day ſpoken of before. The former
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7445:55"/>of which was no more but one only day:
<note place="margin">The day of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which was
<note n="u" place="margin">Ley. 16: 29.23: 27. Num. 29: 7.</note> on the tenth day of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, &amp; was called the day
<note n="x" place="margin">Lev. 23: 27.</note> of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On it was it, that the high preeſt had to enter into
<note n="y" place="margin">Lev. 16: 34. Exod. 30: 10.</note> the moſt-holie place, there to make a general attonement for al. On it had the
<note n="z" place="margin">Lev. 16: 31. 23: 27-32. Num. 29: 7.</note> people to ceaſe from their labors, and to afflict and humble themſelves before the Lord. On it alſo (everie nine &amp; fortith yeer)
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 25: 9.</note> was proclaimed the Iubile following, by the ſound of the trumpet. Five dais after, that is, the
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 23: 33-43. Nu. 29: 12-39. <hi>The feast of tabernacles.</hi>
                  </note> fifteenth of the ſame moneth began the feaſt of tabernacles, the laſt of the principal feaſts in the yeer, and of a verie ſpecial ſolemnitie: ordained to cal to their remembrance, how they dwelt in tents in the wildernes fortie yeers. It continued eight dais, and had a proper ſacrifice for everie one: but the greateſt and moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dais were the firſt and the laſt.</p>
               <p n="41">41 The yeers that were of ſpecial account with them,
<note place="margin">Their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities in yeers. The third yeer.</note> were eſpecially three: the third; the ſeventh; and the fiftith. The ſolemnitie of the third yeer was,
<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 14: 28, 29. &amp; 26: 12-15.</note> that ſo ſoone as they had that yeer ſet out a juſt tith of al ſuch things as God had given them, they ſhould make a ſolemn proteſtation therof before the Lord, that they had truly paid al ſuch duties; that they had withheld, or taken to their own uſe no part of them, whatſoever need or occaſion there was; nor ſuffered
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7445:55"/>any part of them through negligence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in their hands: and therwithal, that they ſhould make their praiers unto the Lord to bleſſe the people, and the land which he had given them. It was alſo ordeined, that that yeer they al ſhould have a more ſpecial care of thoſe that ſtood in need, as namely of the Levite, ſtranger, fatherles and widow; and to that end be of extraordinarie liberalitie towards them, or keepe (as we ſay) open houſe for them. But as touching this point, it cannot be denied, but that the writers do ſomthing varie. For ſom think that this was another tenth beſides the ordinarie tenth of the yeer: others, that it was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tenth that heer is ſpoken of, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie tenth of the yeer, but that it ſhould be this yeer beſtowed not only on the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, but alſo on al the poore generally. Howbeit I take it, that neither of thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can wel ſtand with other parts of the ſcripture heerunto belonging: and that they are not charged, but with proteſtation of ſincere &amp; righteous dealing in thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and not to lay out any other tenth, nor to beſtow that tenth on others, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by law they ought, but only to have more ſpecial care of the poore, and of their own to be more liberal to them.
<note place="margin">Whence this third yeer is to be reko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> And it is to be noted, that this third yeer was not everie third yeer: but the third from the</p>

               <p>ſeventh yeers reſt; and ſo fel no oftener in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but only everie ſeventh, yeer. And therin may we ſee the wiſdom and goodnes of God, that appointed them to make that proteſtation, and to have a ſpecial care of the poore, at ſuch a time as was the eaſieſt for them, being even in the midſt of their plentie: when they might moſt eaſily amend what defaults they had before made, in pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their duties, if any ſuch were; and with leſſe hurt to themſelves be liberal to others. And ſeeing that
<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 15: 9.</note> God doth in any wiſe forbid to have the leſſe care on the poore, when at any time the ſeventh yeer approcheth, much more are they charged to be careful of them, when as it is furtheſt of from them.
<note place="margin">The ſeventh yeer.</note> The ſolemnitie of the ſeventh yeer, reſted in three ſpecial points. Wherof the firſt was, that
<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 23: 10, 11. Lev. 25: 1-7, 20-22.</note> they ſhould that yeer let their ground reſt, and neither ſow nor plant theron; neither yet reap or take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that which it yeelded forth of it ſelfe: but that it ſhould that yeer be common, and ſerve to the uſe of the poorer ſort, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the beaſts and cattel of the feeld. The ſecond was,
<note n="d" place="margin">Deu. 15: 1-6</note> that no man might trouble or ſu his brother for debt: but that for that yeer, he had to ſurceaſe from al ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that ſo, poore creditors might togither have reſt with the land, and ſo, more eaſily pay it after. But yet was it lawful to exact
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7445:56"/>the ſame of ſtrangers, that obſerved not the law of God, and ſo had their ſabbaths in deriſion. And to the end that they might be in this caſe more favorable to their poore brethren, the Lord doth promiſe that his bleſſing ſhal beſuch towards them, that ſo doing they ſhal find no want. The third and laſt was, that
<note n="c" place="margin">Dent. 31: 10-13.</note> everie ſeventh yeer al the people, men, women, and children, and thoſe ſtrangers that dwelt among them, ſhould at the feaſt of tabernacles reſort to the place that the Lord had appointed: and thereſhould have the law read unto them, to the end that they al might know it, and keep it. And ſo it ſeemeth to be meant of this ſeventh yeer, that in another place
<note n="f" place="margin">Deu. 16: 14.</note> there is mention of bringing their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and maidens to the feaſt of taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: wheras
<note n="g" place="margin">Exo. 23: 17.</note> otherwiſe but only the males were required.
<note place="margin">The fiftith yeer.</note> The ſolemnitie of the fiftith yeer was much greater. For firſt of al, that none ſhould be deceived in their rekoning, it
<note n="h" place="margin">Lev. 25: 8, 9.</note> was to be proclaimed openly in al quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the land, and on the day of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in the 49. yeer going before. So that, wheras
<note n="i" place="margin">Lev. 23.27.</note> they had that day to afflict themſelves every yeer: yet in the 49. yeer, on the ſelfeſame day came there to al, this ſpecial news of joy and gladnes. In it
<note n="k" place="margin">Lev. 25: 11, 12.</note> the land ſhould reſt, as in the ſeventh yeer. And bicauſe it might be dowted, how they ſhuld
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7445:57"/>live, when the ſeventh and the fiftith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur togither,
<note n="l" place="margin">Le. 25: 20-22</note> he anſwereth, that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bleſſe the ſixt yeer with increaſe, that they ſhal live therof til new com again. But beſides this, which it had common with the ſeventh yeer, there were two other ſpecial praerogatives to it belonging. One
<note n="m" place="margin">Lev. 25: 10</note> was that freedom muſt be proclaimed and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to al: the other, that
<note n="n" place="margin">Lev. 25: 13.</note> everie one had free acceſſe unto his ancient inhaeritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Which benefits were to be enjoied, not only for that yeer; but for the time that ſhould afterward follow: unles themſelves by ſom new act or deed of theirs ſhould com in bondage, or make away the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Concerning the ſacrifices themſelves (further to help the hardnes therof) it ſhal be good firſt to ſay ſomwhat generally:
<note place="margin">Of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and then to enter into the ſeveral nature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one. Which in my judgement may beſt be done, if we ſhal ſort them al to be one of theſe two, either ordinarie, or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The ordinarie ſacrifice principally is that, which is called the daily ſacrifice: which being once ſet before our eies, wil give unto us ſuch a general knowledge of the nature and form of a ſacrifice, that when we com to the reſt, we ſhal not need, but to diſcourſe of their ſeveral natures, wherin they varie from the other. Thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7445:57"/>may we account ordinarie,
<note place="margin">The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſacrifice.</note> which by the law of God the preeſts were bound ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to offer at their times appointed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other occaſion given, as requeſt of others, or whatſoever els. Of this ſort were divers: but the firſt and principal was that which was called the dailie ſacrifice. Which was
<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 29: 38-42. Num. 28: 1-8.</note> that everie morning and everie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the preeſt ſhould take a lamb of a yeer old, without ſpot, and praeſent it before the Lord, then ſhould he kil and dreſſe it, and lay it on the altar, and there burn it unto the Lord. Wherunto they muſt alſo ad
<note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 29: 40.</note> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantitie of flower, oil, and wine: of flower a tenth part, which was an Omer, which of our meaſure was about a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: of oil and wine, a like quantitie, which was of either of them the fourth part of an Hin, which of our meaſure was about a pint. Laſt of al to the latter part of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice (that is, to the flower, oil, and wine, which alſo is called
<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 2: 1. Num. 28: 5.</note> a meat offering) they ſhould
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 2: 13. <hi>The ſabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oths ſacrifice</hi>
                  </note> ever put ſom ſalt, which in no meat offering might at any time want. Next heerunto is the ſacrifice
<note n="e" place="margin">Nu. 28: 9, 10.</note> of the ſabbaoth, which was no more but the daily ſacrifice doubled: that is, everie morning of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth two lambs, and twiſe ſo much flower,
<note place="margin">Other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per feasts.</note> oil, and wine, as before; and ſo again in the evening. Laſt of al, there was
<note n="f" place="margin">Num. 28: 11-31.</note> another kind of ſacrifice of ſom greater cattel withal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7445:58"/>ordained for their other ſolemn feaſts. As namely, for their three greateſt feaſt dais, Eaſter, Penticoſt, and Tabernacles; for the firſt day of everie moneth; and of the ſeventh moneth, for the firſt and the tenth beſides. For the
<note n="g" place="margin">Num. 28: 11</note> firſt day of everie moneth, for
<note n="h" place="margin">Num. 28: 19, 24.</note> al the eight dais of the feaſt of Eaſter, and for the
<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 28: 27.</note> feaſt of Penticoſt, or weeks there was one kind of ſacrifice provided: for the
<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 29.: 2.</note> firſt day of the ſeventh moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, for that it was
<note n="l" place="margin">Lev. 23: 24. Num. 29: 1.</note> the day of blowing the trumpets; and for
<note n="m" place="margin">Num. 29: 8.</note> the tenth day of the ſame moneth, which
<note n="n" place="margin">Lev. 23: 27.</note> was the day of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation;
<note n="o" place="margin">Num. 29: 36</note> and for the laſt day of the feaſt of the tabernacles, another kind of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſomthing varieng from the other: and for everie day beſides of the feaſt of taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, which began the fifteenth day of the ſame moneth, a ſeveral ſacrifice. But as theſe do in ſom reſpects varie; ſo do they in ſom other agree. They varied in the number of beaſts that were offered: they agree in this, that according to the number of the beaſts that were offered, the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of flower mingled with oil, and the like proportion of wine was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The ſacrifice that (
<note n="p" place="margin">Num. 20: 15, 24, 31.</note> beſides the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice in the morning and evening, with the meat offering therunto belonging) was proper to the firſt day of everie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, to everie day of the feaſt of Eaſter, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7445:58"/>to the feaſt of Penticoſt, or Whitſuntide,
<note n="q" place="margin">Num. 28: 11, 15; 19, 22, 24; 27, 30.</note> was, two yoong bulloks, one ram, ſeven lambs of a yeer old without ſpot for a burnt offering; and an he-goat, for a ſin offering:

The meat offering, or the oblation of flower, oil, and wine that ſhould go with the burnt offering in everie one was like, or kept but one, and the ſelfeſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which was this,
<note n="u" place="margin">Num. 28: 12 13, 14; 20, 21; 28, 29. Num. 29: 3, 4, 6; 9, 10; 14, 15, &amp;c.</note> that to everie bullok ſhould go three tenth deals (that is, about three pottles) of fine flower mingled with oil; and of wine about one quart: to everie ram, of flower, mingled with oil, two pottles; and of wine a third part of an Hin, which was almoſt a pint and an halfe: and to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7445:59"/>everie lamb, of the flower aforeſaid one pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and of wine one pint. As for the oil which was to be mingled with the flower, although the juſt quantitie of it be not heer ſet down: yet ſeemeth it to follow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rate, and to be al one with the wine, as we ſaw in the daily ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="43">43 Theſe other ſacrifices,
<note place="margin">Of thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices that are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie.</note> ſuch as I termed extraordinarie, are thoſe which the preeſts were occaſioned for ſom ſpecial purpoſe to offer: either on the behalfe of the whole people; or on the behalfe of ſeveral perſons, themſelves,
<note place="margin">For the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note> or others. On the behalfe of the whole congregation we read of three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſacrifices which were grounded upon ſom ſpecial purpoſe. For otherwiſe thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of which I have ſpoken before, were on the behalfe of the whole people: &amp; the firſt of theſe that now I have to ſpeak of, had a ſpecial day in the yeer appointed for it, and ſo was ordinarily offered everie yeer once; but yet (in my judgement) commeth neerer to the nature of theſe that follow, than to to the nature of thoſe that are gone before. The firſt therfore,
<note place="margin">On the day of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</note> and the cheefe of thoſe three ſacrifices that now I ſpeak of, was that ſame which was made by the high preeſt and the people togither, in the aforeſaid day of reconciliation, the tenth of Tiſri, their ſeventh moneth. The form or maner of which was this. Firſt there were (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7445:59"/>is ſaid) certain other ſacrifices that day to be offered: as the daily ſacrifice; and the other that was proper unto it as it was a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival day. And theſe might others of the preeſts offer: but this other ſacrifice which was for the peoples reconciliation might none offer
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 16: 3, 32</note> but the high preeſt only, and that in this maner. Firſt
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> he had to waſh, and to put on the holie garments that were ordained for the high preeſt to wear in his miniſtration. Then as touching the very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſolemnitie, there were three principal parts therof. For
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 3, 6, 11</note> firſt he had to offer the ſin offerings to reconcile himſelfe, his houſe, and the people; and to purge the ſanctuarie, and altars from the ſins, that in the one, and on the others were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 20, 21, 22.</note> then he had to ſend away the ſcape-goat: and
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> laſt of al to offer his burnt offerings. To accompliſh this buſines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<note n="f" place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> firſt himſelfe ſhould bring a bullok, for a ſin offering, and a ram for a burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: then
<note n="g" place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> on behalfe of the people ſhould be pręſented two he-goats for a ſin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. Of theſe ſhould he
<note n="h" place="margin">Ver. 6, 11.</note> firſt take the bullok, praeſent him, and ſlay him before the Lord, and take unto him no more of that ſacrifice but the blood, and the fat. Of which two, the
<note n="i" place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> ſat ſhould he burn on the altar for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: but with the
<note n="k" place="margin">Verſ. 12, 13, 14.</note> blood, and with a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7445:60"/>cenſer of hot burning coles taken from the altar, and an handful of incenſe caſt theron, himſelfe
<note n="l" place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> without any companie by, ſhould enter into the in-moſt part of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or into the holieſt place of al, &amp; there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeveral times with his finger ſprinkle of the blood of the bullok, towards the mercie-ſeat, and on the ſame. This being done, then had he to
<note n="m" place="margin">Verſ. 7, 8.</note> com foorth to the doore of the tabernacle, and there in the ſight of the people to caſt lots over thoſe two goats, whether of them ſhould be the ſacrifice, and whether ſhould be let go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. When by lot it was found whether of them ſhould be the ſacrifice,
<note n="n" place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> then ſhould the high preeſt take him, praeſent him, and kil him before the Lord, but (as afore of the bullok) take nothingels, but the fat, &amp; the blood. Of which two, the
<note n="n" place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> fat was burnt for ſacrifice on the altar of burnt offerings: but with the
<note n="p" place="margin">Verſ. 15, 16.</note> blood he ſhould enter in (as afore) into the moſt holie place, and with his finger ſprinkle of it alſo towards the mercie-ſeat, and upon it ſeven times. Then
<note n="q" place="margin">Verſ. 16, 18, 19.</note> comming foorth into the tabernacle of the congregation, he had to do likewiſe with the altar of incenſe: and not only to ſprinkle towards it, as in the in-moſt place before, but alſo to anoint the horns of the altar therwithal, and ſo to clenſe and halow it from the uncleanes of the children of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7445:60"/>Iſrael. And although it be not verie cleerly ſet down in the text, that he had to do ſo to the altar of incenſe with the blood of the bullok at his former comming out: yet bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is appointed that
<note n="r" place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> he ſhould do ſo with the blood of both, and bicauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by divers good likelihoods that he ſhould
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Verſ: 14, 15.</note> firſt diſpatch with the one, before that he ſhould meddle with the other, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt likely, that at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth from the moſt holie place he began this reconciliation at the altar of incenſe for the tabernacle of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the blood of the bullok, and now at his ſecond return thence again, made an end therof with the blood of the goat. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time that the high preeſt was ſo occupied within to make this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only for himſelfe and his familie, but alſo for the whole people of Iſrael, it was in like ſort injoined to the people, that on their parts the better to help forward this reconciliation, they ſhould
<note n="t" place="margin">Verſ. 29, 31 Lev. 23: 27, 29 Num. 29: 7.</note> afflict and humble themſelves before the Lord, with ſorrowful harts bewailing their ſins, &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly praieng to have them forgiven. The reconciliation thus being made, then had the high preeſt
<note n="u" place="margin">Verſ. 20, 21.</note> to com to the living goat, and laieng his hands on his head, there had he to confeſſe &amp; acknowledge al the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and ſins of the people; and to lay
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7445:61"/>them al upon him, ſo to disburden the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of them: and
<note n="x" place="margin">Verſ. 21, 22.</note> therwithal to ſend him away foorthwith from among the people into ſom waſt, by ſom that before-hand ſhould be therunto appointed, who alſo ſhould
<note n="y" place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> not return to the congregation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, til firſt he had waſht himſelfe and his clothes, that ſo no conſcience of ſin remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or returning again, ſhould with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn enter into the harts of any. The third and laſt part of the action was, that the high preeſt had then
<note n="z" place="margin">Verſ. 23, 24.</note> to put off his holie orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the tabernacle of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after he had waſhed, then to put on his other garments, and to offer his two rams for burnt offerings, for himſelfe, and for the people. And as touching the carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the bullok and he goat, wherof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might take (as alreadie I ſhewed) but the fat, and the blood, it was ordained, that
<note n="a" place="margin">Verſ. 27.</note> they ſhould afterward be had out of the hoſt, and there be wholy conſumed with fire: and
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 28.</note> that he that ſhould have that charge given him, ſhould not return into the hoſt again,
<note place="margin">Of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was to be offered, when the congregation had done any thing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.</note> until that he alſo had waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe and his clothes.</p>
               <p n="44">44 Another ſacrifice there was which was to be offered on the behalfe of the whole congregation (and it may be, on the behalfe of any great multitude, though the ſame were but a part of the whole:) but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7445:61"/>had it any ſet day, neither did it carrie that ſolemnitie or majeſtie with it, that this other had which is gon before; and yet was it of great and ſpecial importance. It was to pacifie the wrath of God, when of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the congregation had any way offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wheras therfore it entereth ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the opinion and perſuaſion of man, both that the whole church cannot at any time er; and that, if the offence or error com but of ignorance, then is that but a ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it is as we may ſee to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that for it there was ſuch a ſacrifice provided, as might plainly teach, not only that the whole church might er; but alſo, that it was a dangerous matter in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, though it were done igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly. The maner of this ſacrifice was this. Whenſoever it was found that ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion was committed, then
<note n="a" place="margin">Le. 4: 13-15. Num. 15: 24-26.</note> ſhould the congregation bring a yoong bullok for a ſin offering, and preſent the ſame before the Lord at the doore of the tabernacle, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders laieng their hands on the head of the bullok ſo to teſtifie the confeſſion or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of their ſin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Which being done,
<note n="b" place="margin">Le. 4: 15-18.</note> then had the preeſt to take him and kil him; to take of the blood alſo, and to go into the tabernacle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and there to ſprinkle it ſeven times towards the vail, and to put therof on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7445:62"/>the horns of the altar of incenſe, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting to powr foorth that which was left, at the foote of the altar of burn offerings. Then had he to take
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> the fat from him, and to burn the ſame for the ſacrifice, on the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of burnt offerings: but
<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 20, 21.</note> to ſend away the carcaſe as we heard of the other before.</p>
               <p n="45">45 The third and laſt of this ſort,
<note place="margin">The ſacrifice of the red cow: wherby was made their ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling water.</note> was that ſacrifice, out of which was made
<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 19.</note> that ſprinkling water, that was common to the uſe of the whole congregation, and to be uſed of particular perſons whenſoever any of them was unclean. The ſacrifice was this. The
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> whole congregation ſhould bring a red cow without blemiſh, and upon whom never came yoke:
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> hir ſhould one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior preeſts ſlay without the hoſt in a clean place:
<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 4, 5.</note> then ſhould another take of hir blood and ſprinkle it before the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the congregation ſeven times, and cauſe the cow to be burned in his ſight:
<note n="e" place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> whileſt ſhe was in burning the preeſt ſhuld caſt in cedar wood, and hyſſop, and ſcarlet lace:
<note n="f" place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> the aſhes wherof were to be laid up in a clean place. And when any was to be clenſed,
<note n="g" place="margin">Verſ. 17-19.</note> ſom of the aſhes were to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſpring water, and with a bunch of hyſſop to be ſprinkled on the unclean, but by ſuch an one (a point that none of our holie water-clerks could ever reach, though they alſo would needs be medling) as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7445:62"/>was clean: and this being done both on the third day, and on the ſeventh, then on the ſeventh he might be clean.</p>
               <p n="46">46 Concerning thoſe ſacrifices,
<note place="margin">Of ſacrifices offered on the behalfe of ſeveral perſons.</note> which were offered but on the behalfe of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, now that we are com unto them, it ſhal be good to ſort them by their ſeveral natures: which was, either to take away ſin; or els to give thanks for benefits received. Nevertheles, theſe two ſeveral purpoſes or intents were not ſo diſtinct the one from the other; nor ever ſo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely reſpecting either, but that a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle intention oft times did ariſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſacrifice away with it: which was, to have no other meaning, but to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord, and to exerciſe their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or faith towards him. And though certain kinds of theſe ſacrifices were ſuch, as that by the very nature of them, they did praeciſely reſpect one of thoſe two purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and no mo; as the ſin offering did only reſpect the doing away of the ſin, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the peace offerings nothing els, but thanks-giving: yet the burnt offerings did not ſo ſpecially reſpect the purging of ſin, but that they were done as much in the way of worſhip; &amp; ſo likewiſe manie of the peace offerings beſides. So we have to conſider what were thoſe ſacrifices, that being done on the behalfe of ſeveral perſons, did ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7445:63"/>reſpect the doing away of ſin: and then what they were that did concern giving of thanks. So ſhal we have thoſe among them, that did not ſo praeciſely reſpect either of theſe, but that ſomtimes rather they were done in the way of worſhipping.
<note place="margin">Sin offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> Thoſe that are ſpecially directed to put away ſin, were of three ſorts: ſom for offences wittingly done; others for offences done of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; the third for the very original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature.
<note place="margin">For ſin wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly cont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> Concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe we find two ſacrifices that do properly appertain therunto. The firſt is, when as a man ſhould at any time of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, or want of ſufficient adviſement or care, offend againſt the law of God in ſuch ſort, that although therby he had hurt no bodie els: yet therby he had polluted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. As for example,
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 5: 1-6.</note> if he do not utter the truth (though undemanded) when he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth others ſwear falſly: or if he negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but touch ſuch things as pollute, or if he raſhly vow or promiſe in ſuch ſort that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he perceive himſelfe therby to have done amiſſe. In al theſe caſes, the offender had to confeſſe and acknowledge that he had therin offended: and to bring for his ſacrifice, a female of his ſheep or goats. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles, if the partie were ſo poore that he was not able ſo to do, then
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 5: 7.</note> it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that in ſtead therof he ſhould bring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7445:63"/>two turtle dooves, or two yoong pigeons: as alſo
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> if he were not able to bring thoſe neither, that then he ſhould bring an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah, that is, about a pottle of fine flower; but without either oil or incenſe, for that it was a ſin offering. If he brought his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſheep or goats, ſhe was to be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as other ſin offerings, of which we have ſeen the maner alreadie. If he brought
<note n="d" place="margin">Ver. 8, 9, 10.</note> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or pigeons, the one was to be made a ſin offering (wringing the nek aſunder, but not clean off; ſprinkling part of the blood on the ſide of the altar; and powring the reſt down beſides:) and the other a burnt offering. If it were
<note n="e" place="margin">Verſ. 12, 13.</note> flower, the preeſt had to take out and burn for the ſacrifice an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it; and to take the reſt to himſelfe. The other ſacrifice for ſin wittingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is when a man hath ſo offended, that therby he hath done ſome wrong to his neighbor in his poſſeſſions. As for example,
<note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 6: 1-3.</note> if a man denie to his neighbor that which was taken to him to keep: or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy that which was committed to him of truſt, than the truſt to him committed doth bear: or by unlawful means, as by fraud, robberie, or violence oppreſſe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors: or hath found that which was loſt, and denieth it, and ſweareth falſly. In al which caſes
<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 6: 4, 5. Mat. 5: 24.</note> the dutie of the offender was firſt to make a tru and juſt reſtitution of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7445:64"/>that whole thing which he had unlawfully gotten (to whom it ſhould appertain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it) the ſelfeſame day on which he would be reconciled to the Lord: and not only that, but alſo to ad or put to of his own, the valu of a fift part of that which he tooke. Which when he had done, then had he to com &amp; bring his ſacrifice: which
<note n="h" place="margin">Lev. 6: 6, 7.</note> was ordained to be a ram without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and ſuch as the preeſt himſelfe ſhould aeſteem to be woorth two ſhekles of the ſanctuarie, which is rekoned to about ſix ſhillings and eight pence of our coin. But wheras it is heer required, to make reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom it appertaineth, it is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place made more plain, that is,
<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 5: 5-8.</note> that if the partie be dead, it ſhould be to the next kinſman of him to whom it ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be reſtored: if there be none ſuch, then that it ſhould be given to the preeſt.</p>

For
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 4: 1-12, 22-26, 27-35.</note> if it were the preeſt that offended, he had to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a bullok: if it were a ruler, an he-goat, or an ew-lamb. Again in the ſacrifice of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7445:64"/>preeſt, the blood of his ſacrifice was broght into the holie place there to be ſprinkled as we heard of other before; the fat was to be burnt on the altar of burnt offerings; and
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 6: 30.</note> the carcaſe with al the reſt was to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without the hoſt: but the blood of the other ſacrifices was not to be had in, but only to be ſprinkled on the altar without; and therfore the
<note n="c" place="margin">Le. 6: 26, 30.</note> fat being burned, theſe were not to be carried foorth out of the hoſt to be burned, but they fel to be the preeſts fees, to be eaten in the holie place

<note n="e" place="margin">Le. 5: 14-16.</note> when a man had taken away any conſecrate thing, as firſt fruits, tithes, or ſuch like. In which caſes their ſacrifice was a ram of the woorth of two ſhekles: and they had not only to make reſtitution of the thing taken away, but in this caſe alſo to put to of their own a fift part more.</p>
               <p n="48">48 That which was to do away the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of original corruption,
<note place="margin">A ſacrifice for original ſin.</note> was the ſame
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 12.</note> which was ordained for women that had traveled with childe, and had been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In the which God minding to ſhew, that by the fal of Adam the whole race of mankind is ſo corrupt, that even the childe that is born is by nature laden with ſin, he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7445:65"/>ordained that the mother, by bearing and bringing into the world a childe of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould account hir ſelfe unclean until that ſhe were by a ſpecial ſacrifice clenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But before ſhe might com to offer hir ſacrifice, ſhe was excluded, and ſhut up a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, that ſo ſhe might after com a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without danger; and that at hom ſhe might better enter into the conſideration of the great uncleannes, that we are in by original ſin: and then after that time expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to better purpoſe offer hir ſacrifice. The
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 2, 4.</note> time that ſhe was in this ſort ſhut up, was for a man childe to be in hir uncleanes ſeven dais, and ſo continued thirtie &amp; three dais more, before ſhe might come and offer hir ſacrifice, ſo to make up fortie dais in al: for a
<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> woman child double in both, that is, to be fourteen dais in hir uncleanes, and threeſcore and ſix dais more, before that ſhe might offer hir ſacrifice. That the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie was eaſier for the bearing of a man childe, than for a maid childe, the reaſon may be, for that the woman in paradiſe did firſt offend; and for that everie man childe was afterward to be circumciſed, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tended to the aboliſhing of original ſin. After that ſhe had finiſhed this time at hom,
<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 6, 7, 8.</note> then had ſhe to com and offer hir ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Which was either a lamb of a yeer old, and one turtle doove or yoong pigeon, the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7445:65"/>one for a burnt offering, the other for a ſin offering: or, if ſhe were not able to bring a lamb, then a pair of turtle doves or yoong pigeons, to be imploied in ſacrifice as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="49">49.
<note place="margin">Of peace offerings.</note> Of peace offerings there were two ſorts: yet in effect, and ſubſtance, but one. For they varied but in this, that ſomtimes they did offer them as occaſion praeſently ſerved: and ſomtimes they were vowed or promiſed before. Theſe peace offerings were appointed to be unto them a way or maner of thanks-giving for the goodnes of God generally; or particularly for ſom ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial benefit received: and otherwiſe to be therwithal a kind of worſhipping the Lord; and of exerciſing the religion and faith that they profeſſed.
<note n="a" place="margin">Le. 3: 1, 6, 13</note> Theſe kind of ſacrifices might be of the herd, or of the flok: that is, of great cattel, ſheep, or goats, either male or female. Again, though the blood of theſe alſo
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 3: 2-5, 7-11, 13-17.</note> was to be ſprinkled about the altar, and the fat to be burned with fire: yet the reſt went partly to the uſe of thoſe that brought it, to feaſt togither withal before the Lord; and
<note n="c" place="margin">Le. 7: 31-38.</note> partly to the preeſts for their fees. But the
<note n="d" place="margin">Le. 7: 14-18</note> fleſh muſt be eaten the ſame day; ſaving, that if it were a vow, the next day alſo was then permitted unto them. And it may be, that God did thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, the meat of their ſacrifice to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7445:66"/>ſpent, that prophane people ſhould neither bring the ſacrifice it ſelfe to ſom diſhonor, by keeping their meat til it was nought: nor have any way left unto them to profeſſe a devotion, and yet to be greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent withal; as they might eaſily have been, if after they had offered their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they might have carried hom &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the fleſh that was left, and have ſpent it at their leiſure. For no kind of niggardlines, but liberalitie, and franknes of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth devotion. As alſo on the other ſide it was a good way to cut off licentious and inordinate feaſting, which otherwiſe might eaſily have crept in among them, and have lurked under the praetence of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Again, as burnt offerings had their meat offerings to go therwithal; ſo
<note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 7: 12.</note> peace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings likewiſe: ſaving that in the other no leven was admitted; in theſe, beſides the unlevened cakes, and wafers, they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have
<note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 7: 13.</note> ſom levened bread. But bicauſe
<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 2: 11.</note> no leven might be burned (as
<note n="h" place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> was the maner of al meat offerings) therfore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be for the uſe of thoſe that were there to feaſt.</p>

<note place="margin">How their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to he puniſhed.</note> there do appertain two principal things to be conſidered: what authoritie was erected among them on this behalfe; and what rules were unto it praeſcribed. To
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7445:66"/>find out what authoritie was erected among them,
<note place="margin">What au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie was erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</note> we have to conſider theſe two things: firſt what it was that in the beginning was practiſed among them; then what it was, that afterward by the authoritie of the word ſucceeded.
<note place="margin">What au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie it was that was first in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with them.</note> That which was practiſed among them, hath three principal conſiderations. For firſt of al, while they were in the land of Canaan, they were but few; and ſtrangers themſelves in another countrie: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could have no other government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, than ſuch as maſters have in their own houſholds. And immediately therupon deſcending into Aegypt, as they grew to be mo in number; ſo they grew more and more in bondage to the princes there: and ſo could have no freedom of any higher government; nor that which they had, but much incumbred. But when the time was come that they were to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of Aegypt, and to go to the land of promiſe, then did they fully attain to their freedom, and had of their own a ſoveraign authoritie eſtabliſhed among them. Vnto which third conſideration it is, wherunto eſpecially we have at this praeſent to caſt our eies.
<note place="margin">How the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Moſes was erected.</note> The form of which government was, that unto one man was committed the whole charge: who governing al firſt by himſelfe; afterward, by occaſion, had help of others. This one man, to whom the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7445:67"/>whole was committed, was
<note n="z" place="margin">Exod. 6: 20 &amp; 3: 1.</note> Moſes the ſon of Amram and Iochabed, of the tribe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie. Who at the firſt being left of his mother in deſperate caſe, hid in a basket among a ſort of flags in the water ſide, when yet he was but a quarter old, ſo to avoid the hands of tyrants that moſt cruelly without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion imbrued themſelves with the blood of the Hebrews infants: was nevertheles, both at that time notably praeſerved, by king Pharaohs daughter that there did find him; and afterward was ſo brought up, and advanced to honor in the kings court, that he became an excellent man. Him it pleaſed God to appoint to be the governor of his people Iſrael. Who long before that he was appointed to ſet in hand with the charge, had (as it ſeemeth) ſom underſtanding, one way or other, that God had ordained him therunto: and the ſame ſo plain, that
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 2: 11-13 Acts. 7: 24, 26.</note> both himſelfe began to take upon him, as one that was called to the place of authoritie, both againſt an Aegyptian on behalfe of an Iſraelite, and betwixt two Iſraelites that were contending;
<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 7: 25.</note> and thought that his brethren alſo had certainly known of the purpoſe of God for that matter. Howbeit, although he were thus before-hand ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, that once he ſhould com to that place of authoritie: yet may it be, that as yet he was not called therunto; and ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7445:67"/>conſequently, that that medling of his was ſomwhat inordinate, although notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his zeal was excellent. This is certain, that at that time he
<note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 2: 14, 15. Acts. 7: 27.</note> was interrupted by the diſpleaſure of the king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived againſt him upon that occaſion: that therupon he made no reſiſtance, nor put on armor, that ſo by force he might win to the place, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that God had provided for him; but that he
<note n="e" place="margin">Exo. 2: 15. Acts. 7: 29.</note> gave place, and fled his countrie: &amp; that it
<note n="f" place="margin">Acts. 7: 30.</note> was fortie yeers after, before that he was called of God to ſet in hand with the charge that we ſpeak of.
<note n="g" place="margin">Ex. 2: 15, 21. &amp; 3: 1. Acts. 7: 29.</note> Al which time he was fain to live in a verie low and mean eſtate, but ſuch, as (indeed) was verie meet for thoſe (whether Moſes were free from that fault, or not) that finding themſelves to be ordained to the place of government, do at aventure ſtep to the roome, before that God do cal them unto it. But when thoſe fortie yeers were expired,
<note n="h" place="margin">Ex. 3: 10. Acts. 7: 34, 35.</note> then it pleaſed God to give him a lawful &amp; a manifeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by vertu wherof, he both entered into his office, &amp; afterward attended the ſame ſo long as he lived: firſt leading the people out of Aegypt,
<note place="margin">Inferior ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moſes.</note> and then ruling them in the wildernes. And this he did at the firſt by himſelfe
<note n="i" place="margin">Ex. 4: 18, 20. &amp; 5: 1. &amp; 18: 13-16. Acts. 7: 36.</note> alone for a little ſeaſon. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when Iethro his father in law came unto him, and found, that ſo doing the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of Moſes was verie great, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7445:68"/>and yet that he could in no wiſe diſpatch any ſufficient number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples cauſes, he
<note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 18: 17-23.</note> gave him counſel both for his own ſake, and for the better diſpatch of the peoples cauſes; to chooſe out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people ſuch men as were meet for government, and to make them inferior magiſtrates under him, allotting al to their proper charge: ſom to be over thouſands; ſom over hundreds; ſom over fifties; and ſom over tens. Which counſel of Iethro, though he were but an heathen man: yet Moſes the prophet of God did
<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 18: 24-26. Deu. 1: 9-15.</note> follow: and ſo did better the form of government, both for himſelfe, and fot the people. This being done a few weeks after that they came out of Aegypt,
<note place="margin">A bench of elders with Moſes.</note> before the ſelfeſame yeer was ſpent, or therabout, by another occaſion, the form of government that was alreadie grown unto this, was afterward brought to greater perfection: by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to of an honorable bench of elders to aſſiſt Moſes in the government of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The occaſion was this. The people were verie il to govern, eſpecially to be lead by ſo barren a wildernes, towards a land they wiſt not whither: and ſo miſliking their praeſent eſtate in divers things, did often
<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 16: 2, 3 &amp; 17: 2, 3. &amp; Nu. 11: 1, 4-6.</note> murmur againſt Moſes, that lately had brought them out of the land of Aegypt. Heerupon Moſes in his impatiencie
<note n="n" place="margin">Num. 11: 11-15.</note> did
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7445:68"/>make a greevous complaint unto the Lord, that he was not able to bear the burden of the peoples government: deſiring the Lord, rather to kil him, than that ſtil he ſhould ſtand charged therwith. By occaſion wherof
<note n="o" place="margin">Num. 11: 16, 17, 25.</note> the Lord cauſed him to bring in threeſcore and ten perſons, ſuch as were of the cheefe of the people: and beſtowing on them a certain meaſure of the ſpirit or gifts of Moſes, and ordaining them to ſuſtain the burden with him, did ſo erect a verie hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bench of elders to be aſſiſtant in the government of the people. Which bench of aſſiſtance, though it had no direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be continued: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was afterward divers times revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and reached unto the age of Chriſt. And this was the authoritie that was in ure and practiſe among them.
<note place="margin">As 1.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7445:69"/>As touching under-magiſtrates,
<note place="margin">What under magistrates.</note> there is
<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 16: 18.</note> a law very plainly ſet down, that when the people ſhould com to the land, which God promiſed to bring them unto, and in his good time to give them, then ſhould they chooſe from among themſelves judges and officers in al their cities, to miniſter juſt judgement unto the people. So that
<note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 18: 17.</note> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the counſel of Iethro, under-magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates were appointed according to their perſons, as was moſt meet while they were in the wildernes, and had not there any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to dwel in, nor place of continuance: ſo now by the Lord himſelfe it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that what time they ſhal com to enjoy the land of promiſe, they ſhal in like ſort have magiſtrates choſen, but not according to the number of their perſons now, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of their cities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhal dwel.
<note place="margin">What ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</note> As touching the cheefe, or ſoveraign of al, there was no direct order taken for the eſtabliſhing of any ſuch: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, bicauſe that God would therby ſignifie unto them, that he would himſelfe rule ſo praeſently among them, as that he need not ſet down any law for that matter. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, theſe two things are very cleer, both that God would not leave them deſtitute of a ruler among them: and that he left it in their own libertie, afterward to chooſe them a king, if themſelves ſhould think

Al which promiſes being thoroughly conſidered, although ſom of them be, but of multitudes of people to deſcend of them; others, of particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits ſomtimes: yet do thoſe alſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witnes ſuch a ſpecial favor of God to that people, and that their eſtate ſhould in ſuch ſort be bleſſed, as that when they ſhould grow to be ſuch a people, needs muſt they have an ordinarie magiſtrate to be their governor, or els muſt the Lord himſelfe ſom other way ſupply the ſame.

<note n="h" place="margin">Deu. 18: 15, 18.</note> only told them that he would ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter, that they ſhould not want a prophet; and yet ſet down no certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how to continu a perpetual ſucceſſion of prophets, but reſerved the ſame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to diſpoſe of that matter from time to time, as himſelfe ſhould think good: ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this cheefe or higheſt place of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, he contented himſelfe not to ſet down any certain order for it, but would himſelfe at al times diſpoſe therof as he ſhould think moſt convenient for them: and yet aſſureth them in the mean ſeaſon, that his providence over them ſhould be ſuch, as that they need not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about that matter. Of which he gave them a plain experience, and a ſufficient pattern of that platform that he meant to follow, both in calling
<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 3: 10.</note> Moſes to that place
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7445:70"/>at the firſt; and after his death, appointing
<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 27: 18 Ioſ. 1: 2.</note> Ioſuah to ſucceed in his roome: which courſe likewiſe he afterward followed, in raiſing up whom himſelfe thought good, ſo oft as any occaſion was offered.

<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 17: 14, 15.</note> ſuch, as that although it did not forbid them to chooſe a king, if they were diſpoſed: yet did it praeſcribe ſom rules unto them to be obſerved, and what kind of one he ſhould be that ſhould be choſen: which were, that they ſhould in no wiſe ſet up a ſtranger, but one of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and ſuch as the Lord himſelfe ſhould chooſe. Seeing then that in this ſort it was by law permitted unto them, it doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that if at any time afterward they ſhould uſe this their libertie under the limitation praeſcribed unto them, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of their king were ſufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word of God. Afterward therfore
<note n="m" place="margin">1. Sam. 8: 5.</note> they craved a king, and the Lord appointed whom they ſhould have: and ſo, in proceſſe of time they brought their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to the form of a kingdom.

So have we now found out, unto what perſons the cheefe authoritie of governing the people was by the law of God committed: firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as himſelfe only ſhould chooſe; then unto kings of their own deſire. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this their appointing of kings over them, was of ſubſtancial warrant inough, for that the Lord allowed them ſo to do, if needs they would: yet had it becomd them a great deal better, ſo to have moderated themſelves in this their libertie as that ſtil they had left the ruling and ordering of themſelves wholy and only in the hands of the Lord. Seeing that
<note n="o" place="margin">Num. 23: 22.24: 7.</note> Balaam could a far of ſo plainly behold the praeſent power of God among them, and the very majeſtie of a mightie and glorious kingdom, when as notwithſtanding it was but Moſes that was their cheefe magiſtrate: needs muſt it be reproch unto them, that being ſo neer, yet notwithſtanding did ſo little eſpie it, that for bicauſe they thought that ſame to be wanting, even therfore eſpecially did they ſo much deſire to have a king.</p>
               <p n="52">52 The rules of government that unto

<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 19: 17.</note> to execute juſtice, and not to ſuffer any ſin to tarrie upon an offender for want of rebuke when need required: in matters

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7445:72"/>then thoſe under Moſes, that were over thouſands, hundreds, fifties, and tens; and laſt of al thoſe threeſcore and ten, that were on the bench aſſociate with Moſes:
<note place="margin">Kings.</note> unto their kings whom afterward it might be they would chooſe, it was ordained, that they ſhould

To the end they might do theſe things the better, and whatſoever els was required of them, they had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to get them a copie of the law ſo ſoone as ever they were com to their kingdom, and diligently to ſtudie the ſame al the dais of their life: that, doing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therunto, and declining on neither ſide, neither on the right hand, nor on the left, from the praeſcript and tenor therof, he and his children by that means might have a long, and a proſperous reign on the earth. Beſides theſe generals, one ſpecial co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was given unto them, that they ſhould never bring the people again to the land of Aegypt. Concerning that diligent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7445:72"/>ſtudie of the law,
<note n="i" place="margin">Ioſ. 1: 8.</note> it was in like ſort injoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Ioſuah, when he was appointed to govern the people: and that in reſpect of the office wherunto he was called; and by the mouth of God himſelfe.
<note place="margin">Captains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moſes.</note> Vnto thoſe that were over thouſands, over hundreds, fifties, and tens, it was injoined that they ſhould perform the parts of good judges: that
<note n="k" place="margin">De. 1: 16, 17</note> they ſhould diligently hear, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly determin every cauſe, both for their brethren, and for ſuch ſtrangers as were among them: that they ſhould in no wiſe have any reſpect of perſons, neither of the ſmal, nor of the great: and that ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as were too hard for them, they ſhould refer to Moſes himſelfe.
<note place="margin">Iudges in cities.</note> Vnto thoſe inferior magiſtrates that were to be ordained in their cities, it
<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 16: 18-20,</note> was commanded that they ſhould judge uprightly, regarding no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor wreſting the law: that ſo they might proſper upon the earth.

<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 23: 8.</note> both to blind the eies of the wiſe; and to pervert the words of the righteous. More ſpecially to them
<note n="u" place="margin">De. 17: 8-13</note> it was praeſcribed, that if at any time they ſhould have a matter that was too hard for them to decide at hom, then ſhould they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto the place that the Lord ſhould chooſe, and refer the deciding of the court

Concerning the maner of trial that ſhould be among them, we find that the magiſtrates were ſtreightly charged to ſearch out ſuch matters: &amp; that they had divers wais or means allowed unto them to find out the truth. They were willed to make diligent inquirie, ſomtimes about
<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 13: 14.</note> whole cities that ſhould at any time revolt from the Lord their God to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſomtimes about
<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 17: 4.19: 18.</note> particular men that ſhould be ſuppoſed to have offended. The wais that were allowed unto them, were, ſom more ordinarie: and others more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or cheefly appertaining to certain caſes. Ordinarie it was to have witneſſes: and thoſe ſworn ſomtimes it
<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 5: 1.</note> appeereth. But for that matter it was ordained,
<note n="d" place="margin">Deu. 17: 6.</note> that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7445:73"/>one witnes ſhould not be of force, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any to be guiltie of death;
<note n="e" place="margin">Deu. 19: 15.</note> nor ſo much as be received againſt any, in any other treſpas, or fault whatſoever: but that al ſuch matters ſhould be tried
<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 17: 6.19: 15.</note> by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of two or three at the leaſt. Thoſe that were more ſpecial, are two: othes; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of themſelves by a kind of ſolemn proteſtation. Concerning othes, firſt it is plain,
<note n="g" place="margin">Ex. 22: 7, 8, 10, 11. Lev. 5: 1.</note> that they were allowed to be uſed in matters of judgement, by the appointment of God himſelfe. Then alſo in what caſes, that is,
<note n="h" place="margin">Exo. 22: 7, 8.</note> when a man had given to his neighbor any thing to keep which after was ſtolen, and the theefe could not be found; in which caſe the partie to whom it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be kept, had to purge himſelfe by oth: or
<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 22: 10, 11.</note> in things lent, that came to hurt in the hands of him that borrowed them; in which caſe the partie that borrowed, had to purge himſelfe by oth likewiſe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſame that ſhould ſwear, was but the partie himſelfe: yet
<note n="k" place="margin">Deu. 17: 6, 19: 15. Heb. 6: 16.</note> was it ordained, that the controverſie therby ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. Of purging themſelves by a ſolemn proteſtation, we read of two ſpecial caſes. One
<note n="l" place="margin">Deu. 21: 1-7.</note> that if a man were found ſlain in the feeld, and the partie unknown that did it, then ſhould the inhabitants of the next ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie adjoining to the place, ſtand charged with a ceremonie to that uſe ordained, to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7445:74"/>proteſt their innocencie in that matter. The ceremonie was, that they ſhould com foorth and bring a yoong heifer with them never put to the yoke: with it they ſhould com unto ſom vallie therabout, ſuch as was not plowed or ſowed, but rough, and waſt (ſuch as a murtherer would think a meet place to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit his wickednes in) wherin they ſhould ſlay their heifer, and waſh their hands over the ſame. Their proteſtation was, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they it themſelves; neither knew they who it was that did it: and then had they to deſire the Lord to be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and not to lay innocent blood to their charge. The other caſe was,
<note n="m" place="margin">Num. 5: 12-31.</note> when a man was perſuaded, that his wife had plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the harlot in wedlok. In which caſe the wife denieng the ſame was brought to hir purgation, in maner following. She ſhould be brought to the preeſt with a certain quantitie of barlie flower (about our pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) for hir offering, but without oil, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: then ſhould the preeſt uncover hir head and praeſent hir before the Lord. He ſhould alſo praepare a drink for hir, of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; curſed waters, which ſhould be given hir in an earthen pot to be drunk of: which drink ſhould be thus praepared. He ſhould write in a paper the heavie judgements and curſes of God againſt that ſin, and taking a quantitie of the hallowed water, he ſhould
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7445:74"/>with the ſame waſh out that writing: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he ſhould alſo put of the duſt of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. Which being readie, he ſhould praeſent hir with hir ſacrifice before the Lord, and having burnt an handful therof, recite unto hir in earneſt maner the great and fearful judgements of God againſt hir if ſhe had offended, as that hir bellie ſhould ſwel, hir thigh ſhould rot, and ſhe ſhould be made a fearful example of the wrath of God to al hir neighbors. Wherunto the woman was to anſwer, Amen, Amen: and withal to drink of the drink praepared for hir. Which being done, the woman was diſcharged, and the man was to quiet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for that matter.</p>
               <p n="54">54 Thoſe that concern the puniſhment du to offenders,
<note place="margin">Of publik revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein enimies.</note> do ſomtimes reſpect ſom whole multitude; ſomtimes other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons. Thoſe do reſpect whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, which carrie with them the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of publik revenge. Which publik revenge was to be executed two maner of wais: either abroad upon others; or at hom on their own countrie people.
<note place="margin">What rules therof were praeſcribed.</note> In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they had to execute publik revenge upon others, is ſet down two manet of wais: both by certain general rules; and by ſom particular examples. Thoſe general rules that are, do firſt of al
<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 20: 1, 5-8.</note> charge them in no wiſe to fear though their enimies be mo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7445:75"/>than they: yea, and to diſmiſſe out of the feeld al ſuch as have any maner of occaſion at al (to ſpeak of) to be at hom. As, if any have lately builded a new houſe, planted a vineyard, or married a wife: and generally, as many as were afraid. Which being done, then
<note n="b" place="margin">Deu. 20: 9.</note> had they to ſet captains, and officers over the reſt. Now when they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any forrein citie, firſt
<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 20: 10, 11.</note> they had to offer peace unto them: which being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they had but to make them tributaries unto them. If any citie would not accept of their peace being offered,
<note n="d" place="margin">Deu. 20: 16.</note> or if it were any of the cities of that countrie, which the Lord gave unto them, then had they to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe their battel againſt it.
<note n="e" place="margin">De. 20: 2-3.</note> When they were com nigh to the battel, then was it the part of the preeſt to ſtep foorth and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the people to pluk up their harts, aſſuring them that God would take their parts againſt their enimies. In their ſeege
<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 20: 19, 20.</note> they might not cut down any fruit trees to further them in their enterpriſe: how beit al others they might. When they had woon it, if it were one of the cities of that land,
<note n="g" place="margin">Deu. 20: 16-18.</note> they had to put al that had breath, man, woman, and childe, beaſts, and cattel to the edge of the ſword: if it were ſom forrein countrie
<note n="h" place="margin">Deu. 20: 12-15.</note> they had to put but men only to the edge of the ſword, and ſhould ſave alive both women, and children, and to take the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7445:75"/>whole pray to themſelves.
<note place="margin">Certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples therof.</note> The particular examples that were under the government of Moſes, by whoſe miniſterie the law was given, were eſpecially four: three againſt forrein nations; the fourth againſt ſom of the people of that land which themſelves had to inhabit.
<note place="margin">Amalekites.</note> The forrein people were the Amalekites, Madianites, &amp; Canaanites. The
<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 17: 8.</note> Amalekites came out againſt the people of Iſrael, ſhortly after that they were com into the wildernes, and fought againſt them:
<note n="k" place="margin">Deu. 25: 17, 18.</note> eſpecially againſt the hindmoſt, and againſt thoſe that being feeble and wearie, could not keep with the reſt, but followed after. Therfore
<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 17: 9-13.</note> Moſes cauſed Ioſuah to chooſe him out a power of men, and to go againſt them: whileſt that himſelfe in the mean ſeaſon got up into a mountain there by to pray. At which time the Lord ſo harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the praier of Moſes, and ſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the hand of Ioſuah, that they van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Amalekites, and put them to flight. But
<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 17: 14.</note> to ſhew that this was not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſharp inough for ſo many as ſhould ſo wickedly moleſt the people of God tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling to their promiſed reſt, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſame to be written, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: promiſing that the day ſhould com, when he would for the ſame utterly deſtroy that whole generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the face of the earth. Moſes alſo giveth the people
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7445:76"/>to underſtand,
<note n="n" place="margin">Exo. 17: 16.</note> that for that matter the Lord would have war with Amalek for ever: and
<note n="o" place="margin">Deu. 25: 19.</note> doth give them a plain charge, that when they ſhal be ſetled in their land, and ſhal have gotten themſelves peace in al their borders, then ſhould they go and utterly deſtroy that naughtie people. Which alſo
<note n="p" place="margin">1. Sam. 15: 1-23.</note> was reaſonably wel performed (in the judgement of fleſh &amp; blood) by the hands of Saul, ſent foorth to that end by the Lord himſelfe, about 405. yeers after: and bicauſe it was not ſo thoroughly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as the Lord by his prophet comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therfore the Lord tooke away the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and crown from his line, and beſtowed the ſame on another.
<note place="margin">Madianites.</note> The Madianites a good while after,
<note n="q" place="margin">Num. 31: 2.</note> almoſt at the end of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples pilgrimage,
<note n="r" place="margin">Num. 25: 1-3, 18.</note> provoked certain of the people by women, they &amp; the Moabites to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither (and
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Deut. 23: 4. Mich. 6: 5.</note> as it ſeemeth, by the wicked counſel of Balaam) to commit idolatrie to Baal-Peor. Wherupon
<note n="t" place="margin">Nu. 31: 1-18</note> the Lords wrath was ſo kindled, that he ſent foorth 12000. of the people againſt them under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Phinehas the preeſt, and gave them a verie great overthrow: putting al the males and married women to the edge of the ſword, and among them five kings of the Madianites, and Balaam their prophet; &amp; taking unto them for a pray their goods and cattel, and al the women-children, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7445:76"/>as yet had not lain with man.
<note place="margin">Canaanites.</note> The Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were as yet a forrein people unto them, ſo long as the Iſraelites were in the wildernes. And
<note n="u" place="margin">Nu. 21: 1-3.</note> bicauſe that they, &amp; Arad their king, came foorth to battel againſt them, therfore was there ſom execution by the Iſraelites done among them. But the effect of that which is written therof is no more but this, that the people of Iſrael made a vow unto the Lord, that if he would deliver thoſe enimies of theirs into their hands, they would make an utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; that the Lord delivered them into their hands; and that the people did accordingly as before they promiſed. The other ſpecial example of publik execution which was againſt certain of thoſe people that did injoy ſom part of the land, which the people of Iſrael had now to inhabit, was in order of time
<note n="x" place="margin">Num. 22: 2.</note> before that ſame of the Madianites &amp; it was againſt the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites that dwelt on the eaſt ſide of Iordan as they had to go into the reſidu of the land of promiſe. Which yeeldeth unto us theſe principal points: that
<note n="y" place="margin">Num. 21: 21-25, 31-35. Deu. 2: 24-37 3: 1-7.</note> the people of Iſrael did firſt ſend unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in peaceable maner, to have but paſſage through their land: that the Ammorites denied them that curteſie, and therwithal came foorth with al their power againſt them: that therupon the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſetting upon them by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7445:77"/>and incouragement of the Lord, did utterly deſtroy them, &amp; tooke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves al that they had, even both the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Ammorites.</p>
               <p n="55">55 That which was to be executed on their own country people at hom,
<note place="margin">Of publik vengeance on their own people.

The law that I ſpeak of was for the avoiding of apoſtacie, or falling away from the living Lord. And the effect of it was this: that
<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 13: 12-17.</note> if the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of any of their cities, had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide to the ſervice &amp; worſhip of ſtrange gods, that the reſidu of the people ſhould make diligent inquirie therof; and, if they found it to be ſo indeed, then ſhould they war againſt it, and utterly deſtroy it with fire and ſword, the people, and al that was therin.
<note place="margin">What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it.</note> The examples that I ſpeak of, do aim at the ſelfeſame ſeveritie of juſtice, and in the action or cauſe of religion. One was ſhortly after the giving of the law in the firſt yeer of their pilgrimage,

Firſt therfore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with thoſe that are againſt the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we find the ſentence of death appointed for divers offences of that ſort. As,
<note place="margin">Against the first table. Idolatrie.</note> if againſt the firſt commandement, any bodie ſhould tranſgreſſe,
<note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 22: 19. Lev. 20: 1-5.</note> either by committing ſom act of idolatrie, by giving worſhip to other gods;
<note n="b" place="margin">De. 13: 1-11</note> or but inticing others therto, both theſe tranſgreſſions were to be puniſhed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7445:78"/>with bodilie death: although the partie that ſhould ſo intice, were a prophet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or otherwiſe never ſo deer unto them. So likewiſe,
<note place="margin">Stubbornes against the truth.</note> if againſt the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, any bodie ſhould ſo far tranſgreſſe, as for to do what himſelfe thought good, howſoever the ſame were more eaſily put up, if it were found to be don of ignorance, as before in the treatiſe of ſacrifices is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: yet
<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 15: 30, 31.</note> if it were ſtubbornly done, with an out-ſtretched arm, with an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hart, then was it alſo condemned to death. Which ſeveritie the Lord did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly command to be executed by others: but himſelfe alſo would witnes the ſame by his own example, when as
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 10: 1-3.</note> he deſtroied a couple of preeſts with violent fire as they were burning incenſe to him, only for that they venturouſly tooke (as a matter of great importance) ſuch fire as themſelves thoght good: and at ſuch time as they were not yet wel inured to the maner of worſhip, the tabernacle being then but newly reared. In like maner we find certain tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the third commandement to be condemned to death.

<note n="l" place="margin">Deu. 25: 2, 3.</note> the law of beating ungodly perſons according to the qualitie of the offence, may ſeem to appertain (and that very fitly) to the leſſer treſpaſſes of this kind alſo.</p>
               <p n="57">57 Such as go againſt the ſecond table,
<note place="margin">Against the ſecond table: the fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> are diverſly puniſhed: and firſt of al, thoſe offences that go againſt the fift commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, againſt our ſuperiors: as, our natural parents, magiſtrates, ſpiritual pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and maſters: ſomthing is ſet down directly againſt them in law; and ſomthing we may very wel gather in the example of God himſelfe. In the plain words of the law it ſelfe we find three ſorts of this kind, which are al puniſhable by death. The firſt is,
<note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 21: 15.</note> if any ſhould ſtrike his father or mother: the next,
<note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 21: 17. Lev. 20: 9.</note> if he ſhould but curſe either of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7445:79"/>them: the third,
<note n="c" place="margin">Deu. 21: 18-21.</note> if he lived in droonken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or other kind of riot, and being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and chaſtiſed by his parents, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles remained diſobedient, and would not be ruled. In al theſe caſes the offender was to be put to death: and in the laſt, the parents were charged to be the accuſers of their own diſobedient child. Which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of theirs was allowed that favor, that immediately upon the ſame, execution was to be done: for the men of the citie had foorthwith to ſtone him to death. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that I ſpeak of, wherin we may ſee what ſeveritie God himſelfe hath ſhewed (within the compas of that time that now I have in hand) againſt ſuch offenders, are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially two: one againſt Miriam the ſiſter of Moſes; the other againſt Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their accomplices. For
<note n="d" place="margin">Nu. 12: 1, 10</note> on Miriam, that grudged againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and dignitie of Moſes, he caſt a foul and ſudden leproſie: and on the others that deſpiſed his authoritie, and were diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto him, refuſing to com when he ſent for them,
<note n="e" place="margin">Nu. 16: 1-50</note> a very ſtrange and an horrible judgement. For, thoſe three captain-rebels, with their wives, their children, and al that they had, were ſwallowed up of the earth, the ground ſuddenly opening upon them, and devouring them al: two hundred and fiftie mo beſides, of the ſame conſpiracie,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7445:79"/>and men of name among the people were conſumed ſuddenly with fire: and of the people that murmured againſt Moſes and Aaron for the loſſe of theſe (and ſo belike were infected with the ſaid rebellion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) by a ſudden plaeg, the next day after, fourteen thouſand and ſeven hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="58">58 Thoſe offences that commonly paſſed from one to another of the common ſort,
<note place="margin">Against the ſixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> were oft times more gently dealt withal; and yet notwithſtanding divers of them puniſhable by death likewiſe: eſpecially the cheefe of thoſe two ſorts that go againſt the two next commandements; the ſixt, and the ſeventh. Of thoſe that go againſt the ſixt commandement and have their proper puniſhments appointed for them, there be eſpecially two kinds: one, the deſtroieng of mans life; the other,
<note place="margin">Of thoſe that concern the puniſhment of thoſe that destroy mens lives.</note> ſom other hurt to his bodie. The life of man is deſtroied ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by man himſelfe: ſomtimes by ſom perilous beaſt unto man belonging. When it is deſtroied by man himſelfe, the offender is either known; or not known. When the offender is known, ſomtimes it falleth out that he did it wittingly: ſomtimes that he did it unwares, againſt his wil. If it were wittingly, or of ſet purpoſe, it was either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a free man, or againſt his own bond. If done to a free man,
<note place="margin">Murder.</note> then was it at al times
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7445:80"/>murder (whether it were done with an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie weapon, or but with a ſtone, or a cudgel) and the offender
<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 21: 12, 14. Le. 24: 17, 21. Num. 35: 16-21, 30. De. 19: 11-13</note> was to be put to death: neither might his life be
<note n="b" place="margin">Num. 35: 31, 33, 34.</note> redeemed by putting him to fine for his offence; for that ſo they ſhould verie ſore defile their land with blood, which could in no wiſe be done away but by the blood of him that wittingly had ſhed the blood of the other. If it were but caſualtie,
<note place="margin">Cities of refuge.</note> againſt the wil of him, that did it, then
<note n="c" place="margin">Exo. 21: 13. Nu. 35: 6, 9-15 Deu. 19: 2-4, 7-10. Ioſua. 20: 1-6.</note> were there ſix cities of refuge appointed (three on the one ſide of the water, and three on the other) unto which, al ſuch offenders had libertie to flie, ſo to eſcape the inordinat rage &amp; revenging hand of al ſuch as were frinds to the partie deſtroied, until the matter might be broght to indifferent trial. At which time, if it were found to be murder, then was he to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as afore:
<note place="margin">Chance-medley.</note> if it were found to be caſual, altogither againſt the mind of him that did it, then
<note n="d" place="margin">Num. 35: 22-28.</note> was he to be reſtored to the citie of refuge which he had taken, and there to abide until the death of the high preeſt. At whoſe death, he had libertie to return hom again: but was otherwiſe left open to the danger of death, if at any time he ſhould be found without the bounds and liberties of that citie of refuge which he had taken.
<note place="margin">Striking at one, and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another</note> Yet one caſe there is, wherin it is appointed that a man ſhal die for ſlaieng of one, to whom it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7445:80"/>may be he never ment any hurt at al: as
<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 21: 22, 23.</note> when two men are ſtriving togither, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, meaning to ſtrike his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhould unadviſedly hit a woman with childe, ſo that hirſelfe or hir childe died therof, in ſuch caſe ſhould the partie that did it, be put to death. As indeed it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that although he ment no hurt unto hir; yet that he ment it unto his adverſarie: which conſideration, doth not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it, not to be altogither and meerly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual; but alſo importeth, that being done in the paſſion of anger, though not to hir, but to the other, it wel deſerveth the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death. If at any time
<note n="f" place="margin">De. 21: 1-9. <hi>Of one found ſlain in the feelds.</hi>
                  </note> there ſhould be any bodie found ſlain in the feeld, and not known who did it, then the citie that were next unto him ſhuld com foorth with a kind of ſacrifice, and by a ceremonie of waſhing their hands over it, ſhould proteſt their own innocencie from the blood of that man, and deſire the Lord to be favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto them, and not to lay innocent blood unto their charge. If it were his own

                  </note> bondſervant, and he being his maſter had beat him, ſo that he died under his hands, then was he to be accordingly puniſhed: but, if he died ſhortly after, then, though he were beaten by his maſter a little before, yet if he lived but a day or two, and if there could no hurt appeer of any ſtrokes that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7445:81"/>his maſter gave him, that might ſeem to be the cauſe of his death, then the maſter was cleerly acquitted, for that it is to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that having bought him with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, he would himſelfe be loth to have loſt him.
<note place="margin">The goring ox.</note> If any were ſlain by ſom perilous beaſt to man belonging, as for example by a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ox, in ſuch caſe it was provided, that
<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 21: 28-32.</note> if any man had ſuch an ox, not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have gored any, if at any time the ox beginning to gore, ſhould ſlay either man, woman, or childe, he ſhould for the firſt time leeſe his ox, which ox ſhould be ſtoned to death, and his fleſh might not be eaten. And if the ox before time were known to have that fault, and the owner being told therof, yet notwithſtanding did not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſee unto him, but that after he knew his propertie, he gored any to death, then, if the partie deſtroied were free, not only the ox muſt be deſtroied as afore, but the owner alſo muſt die for the ſame, or at leaſt fine for the redemption of his life:
<note place="margin">Fine.</note> if the partie deſtroied were a bond unto any, then (beſides the loſſe of the ox) the owner had to give but thirtie ſicles unto the maſter of the bond,
<note place="margin">Of thoſe that concerned puniſhment of leſſe hurt.</note> and was then diſcharged. The laws that were provided againſt ſom leſſe hurt of the bodie, were of that nature, that ſom of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerned thoſe that were free: &amp; one other, none but ſuch as were bond.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7445:81"/>Thoſe that concerned the free, were to make good the hurt, that they had done to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times by their own bodies: ſomtimes by their purſe. The recompence that they had to make on their own bodies,
<note n="i" place="margin">Ex. 21: 24, 25 Lev. 24: 19, 20</note> was to have the like bodily hurt by the ſentence of juſtice to be done unto them, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in their rage had done to the other: as eie,
<note place="margin">Eie, for eie: tooth, for tooth, &amp;c.</note> for eie; tooth, for tooth; hand, for hand; foote, for foote; burning for burning; wound, for wound; ſtripe, for ſtripe; breach, for breach: and generally, that howſoever any man had blemiſhed another, ſo ſhould himſelfe be blemiſhed again.
<note place="margin">Costs and damage.</note> By the purſe recompence was to be made, when as two men ſtriving togither, either the
<note n="k" place="margin">Exo. 21: 18, 19.</note> one of themſelves was ſo hurt, that he kept his bed for a ſeaſon though afterward he recovered again; in which caſe he that hurt him, was to pay for his charges in leeſing his time, and for his healing: or
<note n="l" place="margin">Exo. 21: 22, 23. <hi>A woman with childe.</hi>
                  </note> els when either of them did ſo hurt a woman with childe, as that therby ſhe were foorthwith driven to travel before hir time; in which caſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender was to be taxed to the womans husband as by their dais-men ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
<note place="margin">The bond made free.</note> The law that did concern the bond, was no more but this, that if any man ſo ſtrooke his

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7445:82"/>ſhould go free.</p>
               <p n="59">59 Thoſe that appertain to the ſeventh commandement do (in a maner) al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſom fact that is known to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<note place="margin">Against the ſeventh commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but a couple there are, that do concern a fact ſuppoſed.
<note place="margin">Of thoſe that concern a fact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> Thoſe that concern ſom fact committed, are of two ſorts: ſom that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the judgement of death unto the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; others that ordain ſom other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
<note place="margin">Of thoſe that appoint the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death.</note> The judgement of death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for thoſe that are the cheefe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this kind. Wherof ſom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to cleave to the ſex that is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: others do leave the ſex appointed, and are caried to others with their unbrideled and monſterous luſts. Thoſe that keep to the ſex that is ordained, and yet ſin ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie greevouſly, that they are adjudged to die for the ſame, have the ſame judgement allotted unto them, moſt commonly for the odiouſnes only of the fact it ſelfe: but in one caſe the ſame aggrevated by the conſideration of the perſon that doth it. Of thoſe copulations that are themſelves ſo wicked, that the ſentence of death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto them, there be ſom that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern both parties togither: others, but one partie alone. Of the former there are eſpecially three.
<note place="margin">Adulterie.</note> Wherof the firſt is adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: when any man lieth with ſuch a woman, as either is alreadie
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 20: 10. Deut. 22: 22.</note> married to another
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7445:82"/>man; or els is alreadie
<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 22: 23-24.</note> betrothed. In which caſe, both the parties were to ſuffer death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the betrothed, as wel as the maried, if it were in the town or citie, where by hir cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng ſhe might have been holpen: wheras otherwiſe
<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 22: 25-27.</note> if it were in the feeld, where ſhe could not cal for help, then was the woman acquited, if ſo be that the man did force hir therunto.
<note place="margin">Incest.</note> The next is inceſt, carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of neer kinsfolk. As, if any man
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 20: 11, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21.</note> do carnally know, his own mother; his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law; his wives mother; his own ſiſter; his ant by father, or mother; his uncles wife; or his brothers wife. In which caſes both parties were to be put to death: for though the phraſe of the text doth ſomwhat vary in ſom of them; yet the beſt learned do ſo take it, and the circumſtances of the text do ſo import. Where alſo it is to be noted, that he that lieth with his wives mother, was to be brent, and the other with him: even his wife alſo, if ſhe were conſenting therunto. The third and laſt is, to have to do with a woman
<note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 20: 18. <hi>Rape.</hi>
                  </note> in hir flowers:
<note place="margin">In flowers.</note> which was death likewiſe to both. Of the other there be two ſpecial proviſions. The one
<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 22: 25, 26. <hi>Maidenhood lost before marriage.</hi>
                  </note> if a man ſhould force a betrothed woman againſt hir wil: the other
<note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 22: 20, 21.</note> if a woman being taken of any man in marriage for a virgin, be afterward found to have plaied the harlot before. In both which caſes the offenders were to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7445:83"/>put to death: and the woman before hir fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doore.
<note place="margin">The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a preest.</note> The aggravation which before I ſpake of, which ariſeth out of the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the perſon, is, if the daughter
<note n="h" place="margin">Lev. 21: 9.</note> of a preeſt ſhould play the whoore: which if ſhe ſhould do, then were ſhe to be brent to death.
<note place="margin">Buggerie.</note> As for thoſe that by their unnatural and monſterous luſts are caried beyond the ſex that is ordained, after that once they have committed any ſuch fact, both parties
<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 22: 18. Lev. 18: 22, 23. &amp; 20: 13, 15, 16. <hi>Of thoſe that appoint leſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than death.</hi>
                  </note> are appointed to die: whether it were man, with man: or man, or woman with any beaſt. Thoſe laws that ordain ſom other puniſhment are firſt concerning the act of unlawful copulation: then concerning a ſpecial point of diſhoneſtie which a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe woman might ſomtime commit. The unlawful copulation which was not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by death, but in other more gentle maner, was in two ſpecial caſes: the one, with a free woman; the other, with a bond woman.
<note place="margin">Fornication with a free woman.</note> If a man had inticed a yoong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was free, and unbetrothed, and had lien with hir, if hir father was content he ſhould have hit to wife,
<note n="k" place="margin">Exo. 22: 15, 16. Deut. 22: 28, 29. <hi>With a bond woman.</hi>
                  </note> he was bound to indu hir, and to marrie hir, and to give hir father fiftie ſicles of ſilver: if hir father would not give hir in marriage unto him, then was he to pay his monie only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dowrie of virgins. If it were a
<note n="l" place="margin">Lev. 19: 20-22.</note> bond maid, though ſhe were betrothed:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7445:83"/>yet ſo long as ſhe was not given in mariage, nor made free, it mas but beating or ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to both the parties, and a ram for a treſpaſſe offering. That point of diſhoneſtie that a ſhameful woman might ſomtime commit, was,
<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 25: 11, 12.</note> if hir husband and another man ſtriving togither, ſhe being deſirous to helpe hir husband, ſhould lay hold on the others privie members: in which caſe ſhe was to leeſe hir hand.
<note place="margin">Of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a fact ſuppoſed.</note> Thoſe two laws that do concern a fact ſuppoſed, are theſe: the one of jelouſie in marriage, when the man ſuſpected his wife to have broken marriage on hir part; the other of the ſuſpicion of virginitie loſt before marriage.
<note place="margin">Suſpicion of adulterie.</note> Concerning the former,
<note n="n" place="margin">Nu. 5: 11-31</note> it was ordained, that the wife ſhould make hir purgation, by a ceremonie for the ſame purpoſe ordained, in verie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn maner before the Lord: proteſting that ſhe hath not known any other carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſides hir husband, and accurſing hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in fearful and horrible maner, if ever ſhe did it. Concerning the other,

Of theft are reſtrained two kinds: the ſtealing of goods; and the ſtealing of men. Of goods likewiſe two kinds: leading away ſuch as are in the feelds; and breaking into the houſe for ſuch as are there. As for ſuch goods as are in the feeld,
<note place="margin">Stealing goods out of the feeld.</note> it was ordained, that
<note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 22: 1-4.</note> whoſoever ſhould ſteal either ox, or ſheep, if he did either kil it, or ſel it, he ſhould be compelled to reſtore five oxen, for an ox; and four ſheep for a ſheep: if he had them remaining with him, then, whether it was ox, aſſe, or ſheep, he had but to reſtore dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
